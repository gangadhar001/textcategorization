If the first rule of humor is never having to say you're sorry then the 
second rule must be never having to explain yourself.  Few things are 
worse that a joke explained.  In spite of this, and because of requests
for me to post my list o' nicknames, I must admit that no such list
exists.  It was simply a plot device, along with me being the keeper
o' the list, to make the obvious play on the last name of Fuller and to
advance the idea that such a list should be made.

I assumed that the ol' timers would recognize it for what it is.  
Nevertheless, how about a list o' nicknames for alt.atheism posters?
If you think of a good one, just post it and see if others like it.
We could start with those posters who annoy us the most, like Bobby or
Bill.

The number of civilian Iraqi deaths were way over-exaggerated and 
exploited for anti-war emotionalism by the liberal news media.  The
facts are that less Iraqis died in the Gulf War than did civilians 
in any other war of comparable size this century!  This was due mostly
to the short duration coupled with precise surgical bombing techniques
which were technically possible only recently.

The idea that "hundreds of thousands" of Iraqi citizens died is
ludicrous.  Not even "hundreds of thousands" of Iraqi soldiers died,
and they were the ones being targeted!  Or do you think that the US
and its allies were specifically out to kill and maim Iraqi civilians?
Either the smart bombs didn't hit their targets (and we know they did),
or they were targeting civilian targets (!) which is hardly condusive to
destroying Iraq's military potential.  The military mission planners are
not fools, they know they have to hit *military* targets to win a war.
Hitting civilian targets does nothing but unite the people against you,
not a laudable goal if one wants the people to rise up against their
tyrant-dictator.

How about all the innocent people who died in blanket-bombing in WW2?
I don't hear you bemoaning them!  War is never an exact science, but
with smart bombs, it's becoming more exact with a smaller percentage
of civilian casualties.  Sometimes mistakes are made; targets are
misidentified; innocents die.  That's war the way it really is.
But the alternative, to allow tyrannical dictators to treat the earth
like it's one big rummage sale, grabbing everything they can get is
worse.  Like Patrick Henry said some 217 years ago, "I know not what
course others may take -- but as for me, give me liberty, or give me
death!"  War is always the price one must be willing to pay if one
wishes to stay free.

Mathew, your sarcasm is noted but you are completely off-base here.
You come off sounding like a complete peace-nik idiot, although I
feel sure that was not your intent.

So the Iraqi war was wrong, eh?  I'm sure that appeasement would have
worked better than war, just like it did in WW2, eh?  I guess we
shouldn't have fought WW2 either -- just think of all those innocent
German civilians killed in Dresden and Hamburg.  How about all the poor 
French who died in the crossfire because we invaded the continent?  We 
should have just let Hitler take over Europe, and you'd be speaking
German instead of English right now.

Tyrants like Hussein *have* to be stopped.  His kind don't understand
diplomacy; they only understand the point of a gun.  My only regret is
that Bush wimped out and didn't have the military roll into Baghdad, so
now Hussein is still in power and the Iraqi people's sacrifice (not to
mention the 357 Americans who died) was for naught.  Liberating Kuwait 
was a good thing, but wiping Hussein off the map would've been better!

And as for poor, poor Rodney King!  Did you ever stop and think *why*
the jury in the first trial brought back a verdict of "not guilty"?
Those who have been foaming at the mouth for the blood of those
policemen certainly have looked no further than the video tape.
But the jury looked at *all* the evidence, evidence which you and I
have not seen.  When one makes a judgment without the benefit of a
trial where evidence can be presented on both sides, one has simply
lowered himself to the level of vigilante justice, a state-of-mind
which your sarcasm above seemingly spoke against, but instead tends
to support in the case against the policemen.  

Law in this country is intended to protect the rights of the accused,
whether they be criminals or cops.  One is not found guilty if there is
a reasonable doubt of one's guilt, and only the jury is in a position
to assess the evidence and render a verdict.  Anyone else is simply
succumbing to verbal vigilantism.

Jim B.

Sure, a person could have great respect for Jesus and yet be an

I would recommend you to take a look at

1) your dictionary
2) alt.atheism FAQ files

to notice that atheism is _not_ a belief system, and what is common
to all atheists is not a belief, but a _lack of belief in deities_.
I cannot imagine how anyone could do research on atheism without
paying careful attention to this issue.

IMHO, this is a poor method to do any real survey, although I'm sure the
replies might keep you amused for hours.

No, I do _not_ know what you mean. If you are surveying our individual
philosophies, fine, but that's not strictly atheism. Atheism is not
just another, godless version of the theistic explanations for life,
the universe and everything. It is not a belief system, and it could
hardly be called a philosophical system.

Once more: Atheism is characterised by lack of belief in deities. 
Do not twist the meaning, or assume that we have some kind of
philosophy we all agree on.

Some comments on your questions:

I would also like to hear more about this. Have we been able to 'convert'
anyone?

> means (proofs of the non-existence of God, etc), or was it perhaps, at least

This question contains a contradiction in terms. _Beliefs_ 
cannot be acquired rationally - if they could, they would not be 
beliefs! You also seem to have rather strange ideas of how people become
atheists - those who are alienated from religion do not necessarily
become atheists, they just think very little about religion. It seems
it requires a considerable time of honest inquiry to find out that
religions are actually intellectually dishonest virtual realities.

Those who have never had beliefs will certainly find this question
quite odd - how can lack of belief be acquired? When did I acquire
lack of belief in the Easter Bunny? (I did believe in Santa, though ;-))

This question does not make any sense, since atheism does not deal with
these issues - it is not a worldview, or a philosophy, or a belief system.

Sigh, why haven't I seen a good, well-thought survey in the Usenet
for three years... and what is the point of doing surveys in the net,
anyway? Just to abstract some opinions?

Not necessarily. It is much the same problem as the Eve hypothesis. If
all, or most, of the copies that were available when printing became
common were decended from the same copy, a change in that copy would
propagate to all modern copies, even if there were other copies in 
existence at the time of the change. Very few libraries would have
duplicates of a non-religious book, so there would be few opportunities
for anyone to notice that there were variations. Even if someone did
notice, they would be more likely to copy the variation that conformed
to their expectations and ignore the others.

Actually, I've got an entire list of books written by various atheist
authors and I went to the largest bookstore in my area (Pittsburgh) and
couldn't find _any_ of them.  What section of the bookstore do you find
these kinds of books in?  Do you have to look in an "alternative" bookstore
for most of them?  Any help would be appreciated (I can send you the list
if you want).

Indeed.  But that code is law, not morality.  I think the point here was not 
a discussion of anarchy vs. law.  I think that most see the benefit of a non-
anarchistic system.  Our incredibly high standard of living is based on 
technology, derived from an ordered existance.  We wouln't have got far if 
we were still bashing each other over the head with clubs, right?

The question becomes, is it possible to have an ordered society in which 
the laws are recognized to be in place based on _enlightened self interest_ 
as opposed to morality? 

And secondly, assuming a satisfactory _legal_ code is in place, and we 
choose to persue individual freedoms as far as possible, is a _moral 
code_ required or even acceptable?

Can an agreement ever be reached?  At what point do we start to comprimise?

Think about these questions in light of some recent social issues:

	Topic			Legal?		     Moral?
	
	Homosexuality 		Yes		(insertopinionhere)
	Drug use		No		      ditto
	Prostitution		No (gen.)	      ditto
	Abortion		Yes (gen.)	      ditto
	Prayer in school	No (gen.)	      ditto
	Tabacco taxation :-)	Yes		      ditto
	Spanking :-)		Yes		      ditto
	Reading news :-)	Yes		       No

You milage may vary depending on your state/country! :-)

I would guess that it probably has something to do with the ease of which
ideas and thoughts are communicated on a college campus.  In the real world
(tm) it's easier for theists (well, people in general really) to lock
themselves into a little bubble where they only see and talk to those
people who are of the same opinion as they are.  In college you are
constantly surrounded by and have to interact with people who have
different ideas about life, the universe, and everything.  It is much much
harder to build a bubble around yourself to keep everyone else's ideas from
reaching you.

So, in a world where theists are forced to contend with and listen to
atheists and theists of other religions some are bound to have a change in
their beliefs over four years.  There is nowhere to run.... :-)

Once the Rushdie situation exploded into the media, the Muslim voice on
the matter of the book was effectively restricted to short video bytes
showing
the dramatic highlights of Muslim demonstrations. For every twenty or so
newspaper, magazine articles, interviews etc. supporting Rushdie, there
would
appear one Muslim voice. This person was usually selected based on how
dramatic and incoherent he was, not on his knowledge of Islam or the
situation at the time. This approx. twenty to one ratio continued
throughout the escalation of the crisis, with Rushdie in the central
spotlight as the man of the moment, the valiant defender of everyman's
right to free speech decoupled from responsibility. (As an aside, it's
interesting that while the hue and cry about freedom of speech went up,
some books (defaming certain ethnic and religious groups) continued
to be banned here. It was felt that they injured the sensibilities of these

groups and presented a false image which could promote feelings of 
hate towards these groups. For Muslims this kind of double standard 
was annoying.)

Rushdie saw this spotlight as a golden opportunity to lash out at
"organized"
Islam, and he did so with admirable verbal skill. The only kind of Islam
which Rushdie finds palatable is what he calls a "secular" Islam - an Islam
separated from it's Qur'an, it's Prophet, God, its legislation, and most
importantly from any intrusion into any political arena. Fine - Rushdie
made
his views known - the Muslim's made their anger at his book known. The
scale of the whole affair erupted into global proportions - it was, by this
time,
already a political situation - affecting governments as well as
individuals.
The situation was a serious one, with far-reaching political implications.
At the centre of this turmoil was Rushdie, throwing fuel on the fire -
engaged
in a personal crusade that made him oblivious to any sense of caution.

Now you may feel that the person in the centre of a worldwide storm such as

this has no responsibility, has no reason to exercise restraint of any
kind, has no
obligation to perhaps step back momentarily out of the spotlight till
matters calm down. Perhaps you even feel that he is justified in "boldly"
defying the anger of all those who dare to take umbrage at his literary
work, no matter what insult they find within it. Perhaps you see him as
a kind of secular "heroic Knight",mounted on the his media steed,
 doing battle with the "dragon" of Islamic "fundamentalism".

Well Khomeini saw him as a disingeneous author who 
grew up in a Muslim atmosphere, knew well what Muslim's hold dear, 
who wrote a book which mischievously uses certain literary conventions
to slander, insult, and attack Islam and its most notable personalities -
who, when
faced with a situation that became a worldwide crisis, continued with
his mischief in the world stage of the media - who, even after people were
injured and killed because of the magnitude and emotion of the situation,
continued his mischief, instead of having the good sense to desist.
Khomeini saw the crisis as mischief making on a grand scale, mischief
making that grew in scale as the scale of the crisis enlarged. The deaths
of Muslims around the world and Rushdie's continued media mischief
even after this, was the triggering factor that seemed to
decide Khomeini on putting a stop to the mischief. The person at the
centre of all these events was Rushdie - he was the source of the
continuing mischief - all media support, government support was
just that - support. The source was Rushdie (and his publishers, who
were nothing short of ecstatic at the publicity and were very happy
to see Rushdie constantly in the media). The Islamic rulings that
deal with people who engage in this kind of grand-scale mischief
making, was applied to Rushdie.

>You're attempts at justification are not doing the
> image of Islam any good.

I have made no attempts at justification, only at explanation. "Image" is
the chief concern of Muslim 'apologists' for Islam and for Rushdie.
If Muslims willingly relegated themselves to becoming a sub-culture
within a larger secular culture, such that the secular principles and laws
had precedence over the laws of Islam - then I have no doubt that Islam
would then be thought to have a good "image" (Principally because it would
by and large reflect the secular image). A "good image" usually means " be
more
like me".

Your attempts at TOTALLY exonerating Rushdie reflect exactly the attitude
that
resulted in the polarization brought about by the crisis.

The fatwa came later - much later. If Rushdie didn't mouth off so much in
the
media, the fuss would have died down - no one would have been killed, no
fatwa would have been passed - the whole episode would have fizzled away.

Ah! Excellent. So why doesn't she appear to me? I'm a little weak in the
blind faith department. (Besides, she doesn't even really need to appear:
how about, oh say, a little tip - something like "put your all on #3 in the

I'm afraid I don't know arabic; I have only read translations. I wouldn't
know it if it were well-written. (Consistent, though, is one thing the Quran
is not.)  And have *you* read it in arabic?  Besides, some of my best

Yes, so? How do we know they *weren't* very good? (Again, assuming that the

I haven't interviewed all muslims about this; I would really like it if this

What other basis do we have to judge a system? Especially when we can't get
a consistent picture of what Islam "really" is. Do I believe Khomeini? Do I
go by the Imam of the mosque in Mecca? Or perhaps the guy in New Jersey? Or
perhaps you say I should go only by the Quran. Ok, whose translation? And
what about things like "And wherever you find idolators, kill them"?

I am looking for experiences people have had with Mormons and your
views of Mormonism because of these experiences.

I would appreciate only experiences that have happened to you...not
friend of a friend stuff.  Also, I would like to hear good 
experiences you might have had with Mormons.  I am doing this
in the interest of spreading tolerance, so please, no flames.

E-mail would be preferred because of the short time for this.

Thanks,

Well, it looks like the folks in soc.religion.islam have loosened up
a bit and are discussing this topic as well as the banking/interest
topic.  A few books on the subject have also been mentioned in addition
to the one you mentioned.  These may be hard to find, but I think I may
take a stab at it out of curiosity.  I know the one film I saw on this
subject was pretty weak and the only two quotes I have seen which were
used to show science in the Koran (which I posted here) were also pretty 
vague.  I suspect that these books will extrapolate an awful lot on the
quotes they have.

At least one poster on the Islam channel seems to have some misgivings
about the practice of using the Koran to decide what is good science.

I wonder if Islam has ever come up with the equivalent of the Christians
"Creation Science" on any topic.  It would be interesting to find a history
of scientific interpretations of the Koran, to see if anyone used the Koran
to support earlier science which has since been discarded.  It is all too
easy to look at science as it exists today and then "interpret" passages
to match those findings.  People do similar things with the sayings of
Nostradamus all the time.

Anyway, it is a rather unique claim of Islam and may be worth checking.

Basically, any prophet I've ever dealt with has either been busy 
hawking stolen merchandise or selling swampland house lots in 
Florida.  Then you hear all the stories of sexual abuse by prophets
and how the families of victims were paid to keep quiet about it.

Never mind that, but let me tell you about this Chevelle I bought 
from this dude (you guessed it, a prophet) named Mohammed.  I've
got the car for like two days when the tranny kicks, then Manny, 
my mechanic, tells me it was loaded with sawdust!  Take a guess

And, hangings and firing squads are allowed today, too.  And, if these
things were not considered cruel, then surely a medical execution
(painless) would not be, either.

Then you better pray for me, too, because I believe that the Mighty

Prayer in school is legal; what is illegal is telling children
what to pray, or not to pray.  Many people confuse "you can't
tell kids that they ought to pray now" with "kids aren't allowed
to pray", possibly because so few kids do so without being told.

But you STILL value likely ways over unlikely ways, correct? If I wanted to
know the "truth" about, say, the specific gravity of chicken soup, I could 
employ science -- meters, gauges, scales, etc. -- or I could just talk a walk 
on a beach somewhere. Both have a possibility of generating the truthful 
answer -- in the case of the walk on the beach, it would have to be some sort 
of sudden inspiration about the specific gravity of chicken soup which just 
happened to be truthful -- so what makes me choose the scientific method of 
truth-determination over the "walk on the beach" method? Because I *VALUE* 
science's higher probability of obtaining truth, that's why. Everywhere one 
turns, there is intentionality and value judgments lurking just beneath the 
veneer of detached objectivity. It is an inescapable aspect of the human 
condition.

Well, I would add that the attribute "works even when not being measured" is 
*ALSO* something which is valued and intended, Eric. All you've succeeded in 
doing is kicking this up another level in the hierarchy of values.

The point is that when we recognize these "instantiations" of mathematical
systems, we do so because we VALUE being able to describe and perhaps even 
to control these instantiations. There is always a driving purpose behind
thought -- a motive, if you will. Sometimes that motive is relatively 
"pure", e.g. pursuit of knowledge, othertimes it's "impure", e.g. pursuit
of money, or of physical pleasure. But it's always there. And even when it
is a "pure" pursuit of knowledge, presumably one pursues knowledge in order
to personally grow, develop, advance to a higher plane of being. So there
is still an element of acquisition, of reaching, of grasping, even in the
approach of the "detached, objective" scientist.

>They aren't the same.

No, I think you are the one who is rather confused. There are two senses
in which we can say that the phenomenon of "the working of the DES chip" is 
value-based:

	1) Because there is bound to be some reason why we built the DES
	   chip and started it running in the first place

		and

	2) Because the very notion/definition/concept of "works" has value
	   associated with it

The first is a CAUSAL linkage -- we want it to work, therefore we CAUSE it to 
work. That is rather a mundane interpretation. The second, however, is a more 
subtle and deeper PHENOMENOLOGICAL linkage -- that the attribute "works" is 
itself, as everything else, presented to the human consciousness as a _valued_ 
fact, not just a fact-in-itself. You are perhaps justified in shooting down 
the causal linkage, but you have not begun to address the phenomenological 
linkage.

Our predictions or confirmations that suns shine in unpopulated solar systems
are, however, items of value.

Again, our predictions or confirmations of the working of genetic algorithms
are items of value.

The universe does not DEPEND on human values, no, but our experience and
understanding and concepts of the universe _are_ laced with human values.
Phenomenologically, everything is value-related, since the thing which is 
experiencing the phenomena, i.e. self, is itself value-driven. Self is, in 
fact, the very SOURCE of all values. Whatever involves self involves values.

Yes, this took some getting used to -- of course not having an Indian
connection, no knowledge of hindi, etc., this was not trivial for me.
I did have, thanks to the wonders of the net, "A Glossary to *Satanic
Verses*", posted to rec.arts.books by Vijay Raghavan, which explains a
lot of the Indian English constructions, Indian culture references,
even the Islamic references ("Jahilia", "Submission", the context of
the Satanic Verses incident, etc.) -- what I have only covers the
first couple of hundred pages, but it helped me get into the flow of
the novel [I can mail this to anyone interested; if anyone has
portions after part I, if they exist, I'd like to get those].

What is your reaction to people who claim they were abducted by space aliens?

Some of these people say, "I was abducted, experimented on, etc."
If we insist that these aliens don't exist is the burden of proof placed on
us. These people can give no hard facts but can give a lot of testimony to
back up their beliefs.

Replace <space aliens> with <elvis>, <big foot>, <blue unicorns>, 
and we have a larger percentage of the population than I like to think
about.

Sometimes I wonder if reality really is a different experience for everone.

Of course.  Hitchings believes in evolution.  The purpose of the quote I
sited was to show the ambivalance that evolutionists have with their own
theory.  For example, on page 107 he states, "...one may question an 
evolution theory so beset by doubts among even those who teach it.  If
Darwinism is truely the great unifying principle of biology, it encompasses
extraordinarily large areas of ignorance.  It fails to explain some of the
basic questions of all -- how lifeless chemicals came alive, what rules of
grammer lie behind the genetic code, how genes shap and form living things."

SO?
What's your point?

MAYBE TO ME! (In this example, and as I argue below, that's not even
true.)

Not necessarily.

But science is also good for technology, which may or may not
have anything to do with truth. I may value technology and
not truth, after all.

Spare me. This is nonsense, Frank. Pregnancy is sometimes referred
to as having a "bun in the oven." Does this mean that the uterus
is at 450 F? Argument by idiom is weak indeed, and it's what
you're engaging in here.

Of course it's different. $3!=ma. What is at issue is accuracy,
not difference.

>I'm making a decision as to the importance of F=ma
>over other expressions I can compute.
This is the result of a chain of deduction about the value
of understanding the universe. One can make the observation
that IF one wanted to understand the universe, F=ma would be
valuable without believing F=ma to be valuable, Frank.

>I'm valuing it, whether implicitly or
>directly, because I'm saying that things that have a basis in reality
>are different to other things which do not.
Things which have a basis in reality are different from things
which have a basis in reality. Quantum mechanics is very different
from biochemistry, yet they both (allegedly) have basises in reality.
Look, Frank, noone said that people didn't do science because they
value it(in the sense of think it is good), but that is not necessary
to make the observation that it's results have value (in the sense
that they are accurate.) Allow me to give you an example: I think
that knowing the byte order on IBM 3090s is pretty much worthless
(I don't care to know it) but I would be quite prepared to
note as valuable (i.e. accurate) the claim that it was Big-endian
if it was shown to be so (like, by showing me the manual.)

No, it's fleeking not. Scientific judgement is SOLELY the sense
of evaluating an expression (accuracy). It has nothing to do with
importance, worthiness, or usefulness. Choice of problems DOES
have to do with those factors, but they are orthogonal to
evaluating (for accuracy) solutions to chosen problems.

No, I was saying that it works independently of whether I measure
it, which is something quite different.

It would if they were the same thing, which they are not.

Frank, you are attempting to inject "goodness" judgements where there
are only "accuracy" judgements, by essentially punning on the word
'value' which has both meanings. "useful" is a goodness judgement.
"Reasonable" is an accuracy judgement. They are not the same
thing at all. ("Useful in making some conclusion" is an accuracy
judgement again, I'm afraid.) Sorry, Frank, but all you're doing is
using the ambiguity of English to obfuscate the issue. IF you
mean to say that science is based on value (accuracy) judgements,
I have no problem with that. If you mean to say that it's based
on value (goodness) judgements, that's nonsense. By contrast,
morality is clearly based on goodness judgements.

On a similar note, a good friend of mine worked as a clerk in a
chain bookstore.  Several of his peers were amazing, one woman in
particular:

A customer asked her if they had _The Autobiography of Benjamin
Franklin_.  "Who's it by?" was her first question.  Then, "Is he
still alive?"  Then, "Is it fiction or non-fiction?" 

Finally my friend intervened, and showed the guy where it was.
 
It makes one wonder what the standards of employment are.

Could you let us know when this happened, so I can see if my version

#I'm trying to write some code that lets me draw lines and do rubber-band
#boxes in Motif/X.  I'm running on an 8-bit display for which I've created a

#in a drawing area widget -- a widget in which I'm displaying a bitmap using
#XPutImage().  If doesn't matter if the lines I draw interactively stay
#around when the window is refreshed.
#
#Currently, to draw interactively, I begin with:
#
#   /* drawIndex is an colortable index I reserve for the Foreground */
#   /* my_default_bg_color is the color index for the background of my image */
#   palette_colors[drawIndex].red =   palette_colors[my_default_bg_color].red;
#   palette_colors[drawIndex].green = palette_colors[my_default_bg_color].green;
#   palette_colors[drawIndex].blue =  palette_colors[my_default_bg_color].blue;
#   XStoreColors( myDisplay, my_cmap, &palette_colors[DrawIndex], 1);
#   XFlush( myDisplay);
#
#   XSetFunction( myDisplay, gc, GXxor);
#   XSetForeground( myDisplay, gc, drawIndex);
#
#Then to draw I do:
#
#   XDrawLine( myDisplay, XtWindow( drawingArea1), gc, x1, y1, x2, y2);
#   XFlush( myDisplay);
#
#And when I'm all done, to return things to normal I do:
#
#   XSetFunction( myDisplay, gc, GXcopy);
#
#
#What I'd like to happen is for the lines I draw to be the inverse of
#whatever I'm drawing over.  Instead what happens is I get white lines.  If
#the lines are over a white background - nothing shows up.  If the lines are
#over a black area - nothing shows up!  It's very strange.  But the GXxor
#function seems right - since if I do a rubber-banding box, it erases and
#redraws itself correctly (ie. not disturbing the underlying image).
#
#Any suggestions what I'm doing wrong?
#

I believe for this to work on a color display you must set the foreground of
the GC to be (foreground^background).

I have a problem where an Athena strip chart widget is not calling it's
get value function.  I am pretty sure this is happening because I am
not using XtAppMainLoop, but am dealing with events via sockets.  (ya ya).

Anyway, I want to cause a timeout so that the strip chart widget(s) will
call their get value callback.  Or if someone knows another FAST way around
this (or any way for that matter) let me know.  I cannot (or I don't think)
call the XtNgetValue callback myself because I don't have the value for
the third parameter of the get value proc (XtPointer call_data).  

In other words, I want to force a strip chart widget to update itself.

Any ideas anyone?

I need to write an application which does annotation notes
on existing documents.  The annotation could be done several
times by different people.  The idea is something like having
several acetate transparencies stacked on top of each other
so that the user can see through all of them.  I've seen
something like this being done by the oclock client.
Could someone please tell me how to do it in Xt?
Thank you very much.

The shell is waiting for the window-manager to respond to its
positioning request.  The window-manager is not responding because
it thinks the window is already in the right place.

Exactly *why* the two components get into this sulk is unclear to

Does XDM work with DECnet? I have an Ultrix machine running both TCP/IP
and DECnet. I have a number of X-terminals hanging off the Ultrix host also
running TCP/IP and DECnet. Presently I am using XDM for the login procedure
on the X-terminals using TCP/IP. Since XDM is basically just an X-windows
client, shouldn't I be able to run XDM on the DECnet protocol tower as well?

My first inclination is that XDM is not your typical X client. It is making
TCP/IP specific socket calls. In this case the answer would be no; you can
not run XDM over DECnet. Is this right or not? Any feedback is appreciated.

What it has to do with your original question is this: many times 
beginning X users (heck, experienced X users too!) write small test
programs.  Many times they forget to draw only in response to expose
events, and thus see unpreditable results whereby sometimes the application's
graphics show up, and sometimes they don't.  We're just trying to
eliminate all the "easy" explanations  for why you're not seeing your
graphics. 

That being said, why don't you try copying different planes to your
window other than 16 (== 1 << 4).  Try 1, 1<<1, 1<<2, ..., 1<<7
to see it you get any output.  Since you're dipslaying only a single 
plane of your data, it's possible that all the pixel values in your
pixmap have the same value for that color plane.

I think you are running Xapollo , it's a X11R3 server ...

If you want a X11R4 server you should install PSKQ3 (10.3.5) or 10.4
  so you can run Xdomain .

Hi,

  Please reply to me direct as I am not a member of this list.

  I am new to X, so please excuse my lax (read: "probably incorrect")
terminology!

  Environment: Sun Sparc 10, SunOs 4.1.3.  X11R5 path level 23.  My X process
is started by xdm.

  i) I want to setup the backgroud (root window?) of the tvtwm display to
     display the escherknot etc (grey is a very boring colour to work on)!

     The setup is as follows:

        lib/X11/xdm/Xsetup_0    -   xsetroot -bitmap ... etc
        ~user/.xsession         -   xsetroot .... etc
                                    tvtwm

     There are also .tvtwmrc and .Xdefaults files in the (~user) home
     directory.

     The xsetroot in Xsetup_0 displays the appropriate bitmap in the xdm
     login window as expected - very nice!

     Unfortunately, when the users session is started, the background of the
     tvtwm window reverts to grey.  If I manually type xsetroot... in an
     xterm window when the session has started, the background is changed as
     expected.

     The question is: How do I retain the background from the login window
     and/or specify a new background on a per-user basis as part of the
     the users session startup?

 ii) When I open an Xterm on the Sparc 10, not all of the keys are recognised
     and some keys on the keyboard are not sending the correct characters.

     ie: real key       key shown on screen
         ------------   -------------------
         hash           back slash
         tilde          pipe
         double quote   at symbol
         pound          hash
         cursor key     not recognised

     This is very annoying!  Is X at fault here or the machine setup?  I have
     installed the xterm drivers that came with X11R5 in both terminfo and
     termcap as they seemed more uptodate.

     Typing set in an xterm window shows a terminal type of xterm - as
     expected!

  Any help on how to correct either of these problems much appreciated!

  Thanks,

Dave.

Okay, that's good.  I'm typing this from exactly the same setup.
(US-UNIX layout keyboard)  I did install the sunkbd patch, though.

Make sure you're using "ssetroot", which comes with tvtwm.  When tvtwm
starts up, it nukes the existing root window.  Use an "ssetroot" after
tvtwm starts up.   (You could spawn off a "(sleep 10; ssetroot ...)&")
You can also use "VirtualDesktopBackgroundPixmap filename" or just
VirtualDesktopBackground if you just want another color besides grey.

Did you install the sunkbd patch?  It's in the contrib directory on export.
All the keys on my keyboard send events properly, except the following:
The End, PageUp, PageDown on the 6-key cluster aren't recognized.
Even the compose key works.  (Though I can't seem to get the composed
characters in an xterm to get passed.)

Anyone have a fix for the last two?

The situation: running a Fortran executable that creats an Xterm.  An option
in the menu contained in the Xterm runs a Fortran subroutine that creats
a Tektronics-mode Xterm for displaying some graphics.  Typing a <RET> while
the Tektronics-mode Xterm (future reference to this will be "Tek-term") is
active makes the Xterm read future keystrokes but does not shift input focus
to the Xterm (I'm basing that statement on the fact that the border of the 
Tek-term stays the highlighted color and that the Tek-term stays on top of
Xterm.  If what I'm describing isn't input focus, let me know.)  

The xterm can be brought to the top by clicking the mouse button on it.

Subsequent selections from the Xterm of the menu item that displays graphics 
highlihts the border and displays the updated graphics, but does not move 
the Tek-term to the top.  If the Tek-term has been iconized to conserve 
screen space, it stays an icon.


The desired behavior: one of two options - 

    1. Whichever of the windows that is active is always on top of the 
       inactive one.

    2. Whenever the Tek-term is inactivated, it should revert to a icon
       but when it is activated it should become a window on a higher 
       level than the Xterm.

What I think I need: a means of specifying that a Xterm or Tek-term will
be at the highest level and a way to iconify/expand a Xterm and Tek-term.
These commands, would, I'd guess, need to be in the Fortran or in the 
command that starts up the Xterm and Tek-term.

Other information: All this is taking place on a VT-1300 (a DEC dumb 
X-windows terminal) connected to a VAX running VMS and Motif.

Thanks for your time.  If you've got any words of wisdom (other than 
"give up" ;-), please send email to

You can't make GL calls in an XmDrawingArea widget for sure.

I can vouch for that. The GL Widget works pretty well. I have been using it
for sometime now. I'm not sure though whether you can use Xlib calls to draw
into the GL widget. I haven't tried it yet nor have I read the accompanying
documentation completely. Try posting to comp.sys.sgi for more information.
Better still,you will find most of the answers in the  SGI manuals .. there
is a little transition guide which explains the "mixed-model programming"
paradigm(Mixing X and GL).

: |> Does PEX (graPHIGS?) have the same functionality of GL?

Well, PEX is designed as an extension to  X and will be more seamless  but 
then, it is buggy to start with .. opinions again.

  If you need speed, and your client can run on the same host as the X server,
  you should use the shared memory extension to the sample X server (MIT-SHM).
  xdpyinfo  will tell you if your server has this extension. This is certainly
  available with the sample MIT X server running under SunOS.
  A word of warning: make sure your kernel is configured to support shared
  memory. And another word of warning: OpenWindows is slower than the MIT
  server.
  I have written an imaging tool (using XView for the GUI, by the way) which
  yields over 10 frames per second for 512*512*8 bit images, running on a Sparc
  IPC (half the cpu grunt of an IPX). This has proved quite sufficient for
  animations.

1. You need these resources :
	XTerm*EightBitInput:    true
	XTerm*EightBitOutput:    true

2. In the shell you need to do : 
        stty cs8 -istrip 


Good luck .

Time once again to clean out the ol' closet.  Some stuff is up for offers, some
isn't.  Please read carefully.


In the MAKE OFFER department:

	WordPerfect 5.0, upgrade copy.  Includes all disks and all upgrade
	manuals.  Best offer.

	Balance of Power, 1992 edition, for the Amiga.  With manual and reg.
	card.  Best offer.


In the FOR SALE department:

	Technics model 715 auto-reverse open-reel STEREO tape deck.  Because
	it's auto-reverse, this deck records onto tape just like a cassette
	deck does, so it's not very good for splice-type editing.  However,
	I have used it effectively in "tape studio" applications for mastering,
	and it works great.  3.75 and 7.5 ips speeds, supports up to 7" reels.
	Dual lighted VU meters with record indicators.  Full auto-reverse
	capable (and the mechanism works, too!).  Adjustable sound on sound,
	and socket for remote control (I don't know where you'd find one, but
	they used to make 'em), plus a 110VAC unswitched outlet.  This unit
	is in excellent condition and I have had it rebuilt once since I got
	it--works perfectly.

	Price:  $225.00 or best offer, or possible trade (see below).


	Panasonic KX-P1624 printer.  24-pin with 360x360dpi resolution in both
	text and graphics modes.  Warranty cards, manuals, all the usual stuff
	you expect when buying like-new merchandise.  I'm selling it because I
	now have a better printer.  This is the wide carriage version of the
	KX-P1124, by the way.  Test prints are available upon request.

	Price:  $250.00 o.b.o. or trade.


	Excalibur custom pool cue.  19 oz., 13 mm, brass joint, Irish linen
	wrap, could use a new tip but will hold up for a while.  I've got too
	many cues as it is, and don't need this one.  Hits nicely, is very
	straight and in excellent condition.

	Price:  $125.00 o.b.o. or trade.  Imperial hard case (1 butt/1 shaft)
	available for an additional $40.00.


TRADES:  I need the following things, and I have no cash of my own right now,
so if you want to trade, it needs to be straight-across.   The list:

	Amiga ROM upgrade to at LEAST 2.04, preferably 2.1+, with appropriate
	DOS and Workbench.

	1 meg Agnus chip for the Amiga.

	Amiga hard drive and controller (preferably SCSI).

	IBM-compatible hard drive (and controller if not MFM).  This one's 
	touchy, as I have a full-height and don't have room for more unless
	I swap out--needs to be above 100M, and I will consider trading a
	good ST-4096 in the deal.

	Intel 9600EX or 14.4EX or similar EXTERNAL high-speed modem.


This is not a complete list, but it's close.  If you've got something way off
the track of this list, it's probably not going to interest me at this point.
Email responses, please.

in general extended warranties are a ripoff.  this 6yr/60k is really only
3yr/24k because you get the 3yr/36k one *free* with the car.  also, is there
perhaps a deductible you pay each and every time you use the warranty?
also, are certain items excluded from coverage on the extended warranty?
and if you use it at year 4 for some 60 buck job and pay a 50 deduct and then
you have used it so no refund ever!
again, extended warranties are ripoff, high profit items for the dealer.

Junk?  They've made the C&D lists for years due to their excellent handling and  
acceleration.  They have been around since about, oh, 85 or 86, so they're not  
the newest on the lot, and mileage is about five to eight MPG under the class  
leader.  You can get into a 3.0 L v-6 (141 hp) Shadow for $10~11K (the I-4  
turbo a bit more), and a droptop for $14~15K.

   I wouldn't want anyone to make kindling out of my front living-
   room wall and then drive their diesel powered M-60 tank into it,
   shooting super-hot soot all over my curtains and that freshly 
   made kindling.
   In other words, please don't FLAME me!

	  Yup, I'll have to answer for this one.

My wife and I looked at, and drove one last fall. This was a 1992 model.
It was WAYYYYYYYYY underpowered. I could not imagine driving it in the
mountains here in Colorado at anything approaching highway speeds. I
have read that the new 1993 models have a newer, improved hp engine. 

I'm quite serious that I laughed in the salesman face when he said "once
it's broken in it will feel more powerful". I had been used to driving a
Jeep 4.0L 190hp engine. I believe the 92's Land Cruisers (Land Yachts)
were 3.0L, the sames as the 4Runner, which is also underpowered (in my
own personal opinion). 

They are big cars, very roomy, but nothing spectacular.

Well, I was just in your position and I drove all three and liked
all three.  It was a toss-up.  I marginally went with the Pathfinder
based on reliability and looks.

I don't think you can go wrong with any of them.

I find this method much better myself, too, although I do really
hate it when the bolt finally comes loose and the wrench and my
hand both come crashing into my face.  After coming to, which is
about 15 minutes later, I change my clothes (because by this time
all the oil has drained *on* me), and ice my entire face and suck
down about 20 Tylenol to ease the pain.  Later in the day I then
proceed with refilling the engine oil.

It's just crazy how I try and change the oil on my cars in one
weekend---I go through about 3 bottles of Tylenol and 2 bags of ice.

No, of course Porsche doesn't have a patent on the "targa" name.  If that were

makes my car _infinately_ safer than a convertible.

  greetings:
  you may be in luck.  i seem to recall seeing a blurb in one of
the kit car magazines about a company in norway who pulled a
mould (sp?) off a real kubel, and has adapted it to the beetle
floorpan.  as for the suspension, all i can remember about the
vw thing i used to own is that it had about 3" more suspension
travel than a stock beetle, but i'd heard that there were after-
market parts for off-road use that were as good or better.  note
that the major difference (looks wise) between a kubel & a thing
are the hood and the fenders.  the kubel had an external spare
mounted *on* the hood, and the hood sloped down (for visibility?)
sharply, and had rounded fenders.  the thing has a lightly sloped 
hood with the spare mounted inside (unless moved to make for more
luggage space...) and has half-hexagon shaped fenders (imagine a
nut large enough to put a tire *in*, and cut off the bottom half
of it...).
  unfortunately, i don't have that info anymore.  try stopping
at a local bookstore and copying down the phone numbers for the
two big mag's and calling them.  they might be able to get the
number for you (don't forget to calculate the time difference to
norway before calling...).

later,
kc

Save youself the cash.  Take it from a BMW mechanic.  Idiot lights are for just that.  Buy yourself a ballpoint pen and write it down yourself.  Change your oil every 3000 mi. and you will be just fine.

	Follow the regular service intervals in you r book also.

I've got an 89 GT.  It has the smoked taillight assembly.  I think this is where
the water is getting in.  When I first got it (had it for a month), one of the rear
taillights fogged up with moisture.  I took it in to the dealer and they replaced
the entire assembly.  It happened to the other one about 3 months later.  This time
I happened to look in the spare tire well and noticed water standing in there.  The
dealer was more reluctant this time to replace it.  But I convinced them to
fix it.  (They must have had to deal with a number of other probes with the same
problem.)  I haven't noticed water in the taillamps (or the trunk) for the last 2.5
years, but just last month, the taillamp just fogged up again.  I'm going to try
to take it back to get them to fix it again.  I'm real tempted to drill some vent
and drain holes in the tops and bottoms of the assembly and forget about it.  This is
getting very annoying. (Almost every other `89 GT I've seen has had this problem.)

I've been in two _major_ auto accidents, both were multiple car.  The worst
was a head-on three car collision (T intersection and one person ran a stop
sign).  In both cases I was stopped and had no place to go (and I saw it
coming both times).

If you _really_ want to add safety to _any_ car, simply add a cage to the
car.  They are available and cheap (about $500 in the USA).  Add to that
four or five or six point belts and you will walk away from collisions that
were otherwise not survivable.  but instead of people spending a little
extra money, we get legislation that says the gov't must mandate a minimal
level of protection for everyone. 

One other significant factor in improving one's own safety is to get some
training.  This will improve your safety more than any other single
investment will.  Drive/ride defensively (and that does not mean you have
to be a doddering old stick in the mud).  People here tend to enthuse about
autos more than the average (probably in the top 15th percentile in driving
ability), but still we sometimes overlook the obvious.  I've been to two
driving schools, and three riding schools for my motorcycle.  A very
worthwhile investment (and besides, it was a lot of fun too ;-). 

Safety is what you make of it, just because a carmaker doesn't provide you
with an adequate level of protection doesn't mean you have to leave it go at
that.

Yeah, but I hate to follow them with the exhaust at ground level. Not all
diesels are well maintained, either, it seems they run for so long that
people keep them going long after the top end is worn out.

Does anyone know how to reset the service indicator of a BMW after changing
the oil yourself?

Also, I have about 3,000 miles on my 525i and so far only one of the five
yellow service indicators went out. That means I don't need oil service until
it reach approximatly 15,000 miles which doesn't make sense to me. Any idea?

PS of cause I did my first oil change at 1,200 miles

Yep, that's when I noticed it too. I stopped replacing the hood badge  
after the second or third one (at $12.00 each).

2002 drivers used to flash their headlight at each other in greeting. Try  
flashing your headlights at a 318i driver and see what kind of look you  
get. They usually check their radar detector...they think you're alerting  
them to a cop.

I don't know if it's as much an issue of their ablility to handle the

However, if you encounter a '93 Formula with 5.7L & 6-Speed Manual,
You'll be SOL, I'm afraid. ;) BTW, I know of what I speak as a former

Don't worry about leaks.  Don't worry about which way to turn the damn thing.
Take a good claw hammer and pry it straight out.  Now, you'll notice, after
all the oil pours out, that there are no theads where there used to be.

Thats why 'heli coils' were invented.  Yes, buy a few of these gems, and
rethread the hole a little larger each time you change the oil.
When the hole gets too big for any heli coil you can buy, its time to trade in
the car...

	Well, let's see, in just my own _personal_ experience there's

Minnesota, Montana, Florida, and parts of Louisianna.

	Nobody said "Let's go into town and drive 130 on Main St."
And you couldn't go that fast on the graveled washboard that passes

Three, actually.  I believe I discussed countersteering a horse
before.

Basically, there are two ways to steer a horse, plow-rein and
neck-rein.  Plow-reining steers him by keeping the reins separate, and
you pull in the direction you wish to go.  Neck-reining steers a horse
by holding the reins together in one hand, and pulling against the
horse's neck in the direction you wish to go.  When training a
plow-steering horse to neck-rein, one technique is to cross the reins
under his necks.  Thus, when neck-reining to the left, the right rein
pulls against the right side of the neck, but the left side of the bit
(which the horse is used to from his plow-reining days).

Are you sorry you asked yet?

Well, it's been fun. This is my last day at Bellcore and
It will be a while before I have net access again (taking
time off and scheduling Military Schools for the summer
on joint operations, and anything else that looks good).
I have had a blast reading, responding and commenting on
things posted here. My final say is 9mm's are inferior
to .45's errr oh wrong news group. Hopefully I'll be back.
I guess "internet withdrawl" starts around 1pm or so and
considering I never knew inet existed 2 years ago I am
really going to miss it. 

OH yea, to the guy who called me this morning about the
"Military issue" boots, good luck, I think you will be
happy with the tankers boots.

I am in complete concordance with you there, Mike.  I was a Silver StarRider
instructor, for a while.  I learn't about countersteering last year
and I have been riding bikes since 1976.  We were never told about
countersteering when being taught to instruct.  It doesn't seem to have
affected me or my friends or pupils.  We just rode in blissful ignorance.

One day out riding, my friend and i were passing a field of goats and
noticed 2 out on the road. As we slowed to pass the ram made a dash at 
my friend just missing him and then tangling it self up in the barb wire
fence. Being good samaritains and generally nice guys we turned around to 
untrangle the goat from the barbed wire. As I pulled up next to him
(seeing him still tangled up), stopped the bike and got off the Goat had
vanished (into the field I guess).

Anti Freeze

I was wrong, still had the issue of "Street Rodder" in
my last pile. In the February 1991 issue on page 24 there
is an advirtisement for anti freeze.
 
AND IT MAKES A GREAT PARTY MIXER
The Neo Synthetic Oil Company has a reputation for
developing overkill priducts the protect and extend
the life of mechinical things, and here is there latest
development. Propylene Glycol, probably the finest radiator 
coolant available. After 100,000 miles of testing, they find
it has a boiling point of 365 degrees (much higher than
conventional coolants)- which helps elminate detonation and 
pinging, it allows the use of smaller radiators in race cars,
it will not damage aluminum blocks or heads, and it is 
environmentally safe. Yep, this is the good stuff.

If he's not, I will.  Put two riders on identical machines.  It's the
one who knows what he's doing, and why, that will be faster.  It *may*
be possible to improve your technique if you have no idea what it is,
through trial and error, but it is not very effective methodology.
Only by understanding the technique of steering a motorcycle can one
improve on that technique (I hold that this applies to any human
endeavor).

Do you consider an understanding of the physics of traction absurd?
Are you seriously suggesting that one can form a traction management
policy without understanding what it is or what factors increase or
decrease available traction?  Braking?

It is highly unlikely that any biker is going to develop his maximum
swerving ability without any knowledge of turning techniques.  For most
of his riding life this may not be a problem, but in an emergency
situation it is very definately placing him at a disadvantage.

>But by including countersteering

I disagree.  The existance and immense success of riding courses which
teach the technique indicate that the concept can be taught in a manner
that is neither confusing, nor detracts from any other aspects of the
course.

>And that was my original point.

Perhaps, but in the ensuing discussion, you strayed far from that
point, to claim that knowledge of steering technique is irrelevant to a
rider's ability.  I find this assertion ludicrous.

THe original battery in an 8-10 year old BMW may be fine.  Mine lasted many
years.  The replacement 30AH battery from BMW was a disaster.  The mechanic
from Comp. Acc. told me that CA would warantee replace the bad one with a
new one of the same evil bad batteries and tell the customer if they have
problems to bring it back and they'd do it again.  It seems that many of
those 30AH batteries were DOA, near-DOA, and always unlikely to be going
strong by the end of the warantee period on them.  THere was a big batch of
bad ones, and they replaced them with -you guessed it - more bad ones.  BMW
switched to a 25AH battery that has more cold cranking amps, even if it has
less total juice.  

I switched to a YUASA that has even more cold cranking amps and cost one
third fewer dollars.

Javy Lopez has proven, over 1400+ AB in the minor leagues, that he is
ready to play in the majors. He is *not* being rushed. Players who are
clearly too good for AA and play behind stiffs at the major league level
are wasting their time, and may actually have a court case against
major league management for keeping them, at AAA.

Unless Lopez is *me* defensively (I'm 5'7'', 165 and born to play
second base :-)), he belongs in the major leagues.

Valentine isn't saying he should back up. He's saying he should be put
in a position to *win* the job in the major leagues, which, IMHO, he
would if given the opportunity. (Val, if I'm misinterpreting, please
let me know.)

But the players who *are* ready are 1)the best and 2) the ones most
likely to benefit from being in the majors. Javy Lopez is not a middle-
of-the-road prospect. He's the real thing. NOW. 

Again, the most important thing a player can do is hit. Lopez does that
miles better than Olson or Berryhill. If his defense is good enough for
Greenville, or Richmond, it's good enough for Atlanta. If he really was
awful defensively, he would no longer be a catcher. See Sprague, Ed.

Oh, where to start... OK. First of all, solid != good. I want good players.
Solid is one of those words used to describe nice white guys who really
aren't very good at baseball. Think of it as "TWG" without the caps.
It's a losing strategy to say, "We have solid guys, we don't need to improve."
You used it four times in that paragraph, BTW.

Same for experienced. I might add, though, that Greg Olson and Damon
Berryhill aren't exactly Carter and Fisk. Olson has played three years,
Berryhill five, although 90 and 91 were a wash. The only difference,
IMHO, between Olson and Valle is the supporting cast.

"Two big bats." Hrm. I like Justice, but I find Mr. Gant's trend disturbing.
Call it one and a maybe. The Braves' platoon is OK, but neither player
has *any* value outside of the platoon. Bream vs. LH and Hunter vs. RH
are awful. I'll leave the thirdbase comment alone. Pendleton has wasted
too much bandwidth already. If the CF platoon hits .300, I'll retrace
Mr. Likhani's midnight run down Forbes, and I live in NY and LA.
(Got that, Mike?)

And doesn't Cox call pitches, anyway?

Nope. They're baseball management, possible the most short-sighted 
collection of people in the nation. Do you not believe this goes on,
Mark? Do you think Frank Thomas needed those three months in AAA in
1990? Or Cal Eldred wasn't *really* better than Ricky Bones last year?

Might? You'd have to have no sense of humor at all not to! My favorite

the LGTGAH (who is that named after, I can't remember), and the box score

  I didn't say that.  Did you say that?  Wow, I can't believe that
anyone would think that the Braves (or any other team, for that matter)

that was what they thought.  Incredible.

According to the Atlanta paper, Bream will be the full-time first baseman
with Klesko used as a late-inning defensive replacement if Bream is lifted
for a pinch-runner. He'd have to hit a homer in his first AB (or win the
game or do some other amazing thing) to be rewarded with a start so he could
even attempt to push Hunter or Bream out of the lineup.

I agree with Nick.  What's the big deal about long games?  If you want
to watch baseball, there's that much more baseball to watch.  And yes,
baseball includes the space between plays as well as the plays themselves.

I suspect that a lot of the complaining about long games, especially when
it's coming from TV people, has to something to do with advertising.
Probably time "wasted" in the middle of an inning, say by a batter
stepping out of the box to fiddle with his gloves, or by a pitcher
walking around behind the mound trying to collect his thoughts, could
otherwise be sold as advertising time.

The problem with your nihilistic approach, Roger, is that it takes all the
sense out of the game.  By your line of reasoning, if a guy hits into a
double play with one out and the bases loaded, there's no point in saying
that that was a bad thing to do (if his team won anyway) or speculating
on what might have happened if things had gone otherwise, so the double
play is merely an event that happened in the course of a game that was
eventually won or lost for unknown reasons.  After all, any speculation
involves constructing a fantasy about what would have happened but didn't.

Roger, do you ever worry that the next pencil you drop will fall to the
ceiling instead?  Or are you willing to consider empirical evidence?

Teams go to the post-season when they win more games than anybody else
in their division.  If they don't make the post-season, they don't win the
Series.  Will you agree that winning a division is a useful intermediate
goal in ring-collecting?

If so, you must agree that winning games is a useful intermediate goal
towards winning the division, and our disagreements come when we consider
how to win games.

In your viewpoint as expressed, winning games happens for reasons that
cannot be analyzed.  While many of us are thinking things like "Base-
runners are good, outs are bad, and therefore walks are better than
double plays with the bases loaded", you are thinking things like
"It's a team game, so perhaps the double play will cause some mysterious
team dynamics that will cause the team to win today".

The result is that it becomes impossible to say *anything* about individual
players.  Perhaps Atlanta would have won the Series with me playing left
field.  After all, perhaps in some way my knowledge and personality would
have helped the team more than my complete lack of skill would have hurt
it.  Therefore, I could be an extremely valuable player.  Did Dave Winfield
have anything to do with the Jays' victory?  Probably, but how do you know?
If you replace him with Andres Galarraga, perhaps the Jays would have won,
perhaps they would have lost, perhaps they would have defected to Alpha
Centauri (bearing in mind that the flying saucers would not have landed
in mid-season had Winfield been DHing for Toronto).

Was Babe Ruth a good player?  He played on some WS-winning teams, but did
he have anything to do with their success?

It is generally accepted that Ernie Banks was a good baseball player, and
Jarvis Brown and Dan Schatzeder weren't.  It seems to me that anybody who
would deny this needs to provide the proof.

Now, we have observed things about baseball over the years, both empirically
and by looking at the rulebook.  It is necessary to score more runs than
one's opponent to win the game, so it would seem important to score runs
and to prevent one's opponent from scoring.  Runs are scored while a team
is batting, and an inning ends after the third out, so it would seem that
making outs is bad while hitting home runs is good.  Players have tendencies
to hit or pitch at certain levels, and these are usually somewhat consistent
from year to year.

We do use these statistics to predict winners, and so do you.  To make
some flat predictions:  Barry Bonds will have a higher OBP+SLG than
Gene Larkin this year.  The Braves will finish ahead of the Rockies
in the standings.  The Tigers will score more runs than the Royals, but
will also give up more.  I would be astonished if any of these turned
out to be false, and, I suspect, so would you.  As a matter of fact, I
am pretty sure I can predict all the division winners this year, given
3-4 guesses per division, and this is certainly better than random
chance (and almost statistically significant).

If you will admit that the Rockies and Mariners are unlikely to meet in
the World Series, you must admit that there is some sort of way to measure
likelihoods, however fuzzy.

So how about "real life"?  Person A robs a service station with two people
in it, using a .38 automatic pistol, gets $42, and is convicted and sentenced
for three years.  Person B, with a similar criminal record, robs a service
station with two people in it, using a .38 revolver, gets $42, and is
convicted.  Since they used two different types of handgun, are comparisons
totally meaningless?

Say you drop a pencil to see if the gravity still works (my cats are always
testing this - they don't trust me to pay the gravity bill on time).  You
have never dropped a pencil at that exact time of the century before, so
all previous evidence is meaningless?  Or would you be surprised if it flew
out the window instead of hitting the desk?

I hesitate to make assumptions about other people when they write, but
neither of you two *sound* as though you have kids, and you may not have
spouses either.

Consider a night game starting at 7:05 PM EST.  (It was 7:35 last year,
but Cleveland showed what I thought was good sense in pushing it back.)
I go, and I'm into it until 11 PM minimum.  Extra innings could put me
well past midnight.  Even without extra innings, if the score is beyond
2-1 I can't see my family that night at all.  If the next day is a workday,
I may have to bag that as well.  Further, the later the game goes, the
colder it gets on the shore of Lake Erie.

All that stuff enters into my consideration of even going to a game.  If
you say you don't care about whether the game is sped up, IMPO you are 
saying you don't care where the time goes, and that the game is for people
who don't have families and don't have to get up for work the next day.

We cannot isolate completely, Roger, but we can make a pretty good
estimate. I won't claim to split hairs and say that we can really
measure who was better, Robby Alomar or Carlos Baerga, last year; the
difference is too close to call. But Larkin and Lee? Clemens and
Morris? The differences are too great there.

In your measure of the game, why should a team that has just won it
all ever replace a single player? Since they are now clearly "best",
how can they do better? Yet every team can always find someplace where
they beleive they can improve the team; they can always find a player
a little better than one they already have. (BTW, by my definitions,
the "best" player is the one who does the most things to help his team
win. I will allow that this could vary depending on who else is on the
team, by having aptitudes one team needs more than others.)

Baseball is a team game, but it is made of individual talents. It is
absurd to judge the success or failure of an individual by the success
or failure of his teammates, whom he did not choose (at least in most
cases.) Morris won last year because he played on a team with Joe
Carter, Robby Alomar, Tom Henke, Juan Guzman, John Olerud, et al.
Clemens lost because he was surrounded by such lesser performers as
Herm Winninham, Luis Rivera, and Jeff Reardon. To define the quality
of the team as a sum of its components (as I do, albeit imperfectly)
is a lesser error than defining the quality of an individual as the
mean quality of the team (as my reading of your arguments suggests you
do)

A few weeks ago I posted about the Phillies team personalities.  Did anyone see the ESPN feature on the Phils on Monday Night.  John Kruk had a great line.  He was talking about people on the team always playing and not sitting out because of a minor injury.  He said if they do they know we'll kick their ass.  The 
time I saw in was in the afternoon and it was not bleeped.  When I saw it at
they bleeped "ass."  Mitch Williams talked about the team being a bunch of 
throwaways from other teams, and that is why they are so close.  Kruk said that
they all get along this year.  Last year, he said, they hated the pitchers.  I 
assume he was joking, but he always keeps a straight face when he talks.  Oh,
What a team!!!!!

I do, but I don't have time to type the whole thing in (I don't mind looking
up specific date ranges or individual games when I can, but there are
limits). 

Besides, this stuff is EASY to find. Baseball America puts out a book called
the Directory. It's $10(US). Has every team's data and schedule in it. If I
WERE to type in the whole scheudle, I'd just be spending a lot of time
infringing on their copyright.

Folks who are interested in the minors should check out my minor league list
(see the signature), and folks who are tracking down team schedules should
chec out the BA Directory. You can order it from 800-845-2726. I find it
indispenable.

Okay, I'm curious. Why? Are you expectin the Commissioner to fly in and

Funny.  I didn't realize Mr. Tanner brought up Bob Knepper v. Pam Postema

Why?  If a statement is truly idiotic, and is universally thought so,
the challenge is a waste of panting.  Further, challenges that have
nothing (yes, nothing) to do with *baseball* are wasting others' time.

You got a problem with what Bob Knepper thinks?  Let's hear it, in
some sort of categorical manner.  (Actually, I question whether either
Knepper or Postema aren't "old news" at this point, although what I
have read of Postema's book is interesting.)

Yo.  Even elementary school children have had access to our postings,
albeit in an edited form.  You want them to hear you talk like this?
Don't you want people who come to this group to talk baseball to think
you like to do the same?  Or do you want them to think you're some 
politically correct demagogue who's oh-so sensitive?  (Ho-hum.)

Plus, you're here limiting free speech to "some obscure newsgroup that
I don't read."  What BS.  You got a problem with what Jacobs says, what
Knepper thinks, all you have to do is defeat it with better ideas, more
and better speech.  Yours is the easy way out.

As for Knepper: ever notice how sometimes these guys will say just about
any darn thing that pops in their heads when a mike is shoved in front of
them?  You know that often the best copy for the news is the one that isn't
pre-prepared.  They know Knepper has controversial ideas about women, they
pop some question about Postema.  (An interesting related question would 
be whether the two ever appeared in the same game.  Off the top of my head,
I guess "no."  If my guess is right, Knepper popped off about something that
had nothing to do with him -- and Postema gets a book for it, and he doesn't.)

Last week I posted the ALL-TIME GREATEST PLAYERS (and haphazardly misspelled
several names--SORRY!)  This week, it's time for the greatest PEAK players.
I evaluated the following players on 4 consectutive seasons which constituted

I hope there are some surprises here: Raines above Muisial?  Carter above
 Bench?  Ripken above Banks?  Bonds above Mays?
Check the numbers of each player in comparison to the numbers of the rest
of the players that year(s), and you'll see that I'm fairly close with
this ranking system (which is primarily based on Total Player Rating) for
four consecutive years.

A method which will directly (almost) provide you with the information that
you require is that which is commonly used for coordinate measurements of 
human body landmarks (eg. the SELSPOT system by SELSPOT AB, Sweden, and the
WATSMART System ??).  These use lateral photoeffect detectors [Lindholm and
Oberg, 1974; Woltring and Marsolais, 1980] to determine the position of a
spot of light projected (using a camera lens) over its surface.  In escence,
the detector is a large photodiode with four cathodes (one on each of the
four sides of the square detector crystal) and a single anode (the back of
the crystal).  A spot of light will produce currents which are proportional
to the position of the spot on the detector's face.  Let's try some ASCII
graphics in 2-D (so the detector has two cathodes to detect linear position)

If the dot of light from the LED is the ONLY source of light, then the position
of the projection is given by this circuit regardless of the level of illumina-
tion (the divider is used to normalize relative to total received power).  When
this circuit is used in the presence of other sources of light, then the way of
"tuning" to it is to sample for a few msec the background signal, light the LED
for an equal time and sample that signal separately.  The difference between
the two is the position of the LED.

Hamamatsu photonics sells linear and 2-D lateral photoeffect detectors, and
they also sell the required signal processing electronics.  The ready-made
systems by SELSPOT and others are NOT cheap ... 

Lindholm, L.E., and K.E. Oberg, "An Optoelectronic Instrument for Remote
On-Line Movement Monitoring", Biotelemetry, 1, 94-95, 1974.

Woltring, H.J., and E.B. Marsolais, "Opto-Electronic (SELSPOT) Gait Measure-
ments in Two and Three Dimensional Space - A Preliminary Report", Bull. Pros-
thetics Research, 46-52, 1980.

Most probably this technique can provide you with a much more accurate
measurement than you need, but I think that its simplicity beats scanning
a quadrant detector with a pan/tilt system until you reach zero difference.

I am looking for information on infra red based position encoders.

The idea would be to bounce the infrared source off a wall and the device would
read out the distance.

preferable it would be rs-232 addressable.



Any leads?

One of the easiest, and really very used ways of copyprotection, is to mark 
a specific sector on the installation disk bad. This is very easy to get 
around, though, if you have any knowledge of hw-hacking, but most 'normal' 
users (yes those lowly key-punchers) don't. Whatever you do, please do 
_not_ use a hardware key. These were very popular a few years ago, and they

I don't want to get into a semantic argument, but contrary to some other
postings "near UV light" /is/ "actual UV light."  The "near" means that
it is close to the visible spectrum (i.e. of relatively long wavelength),
not that it is "nearly UV."  (I'm sure you can figure out now just what
"far UV" is.)

Regular incandenscent flashlight bulbs emit tiny amounts of UV in the
near end of the spectrum, such that a filter can be used to remove the
visible light and thus create a weak UV source.  Stronger sources are
going to require gas (probably mercury vapor) discharge tubes (such as
fluorescent tubes with UV phosphor).  Be careful, though; strong UV
sources can cause physiological damage, especially to the eyes.  The
shorter wavelengths are the most dangerous.

It wouldn't project a beam like a flashlight, but replacing the tubes
in a portable fluorescent lantern with UV tubes would be a relatively
cheap way to create a portable source.  It would be bright enough to
be useful, but not dangerously so.

There was a news article a little while ago reporting a type of car (was
it a Volvo?) was found to stall if you used a certain brand/model of cellular
phone in it.  I seem to remember the car was recalled to fix the problem.

Hmmmmm... this has possibilities:
If the police are in pursuit of a vehicle, maybe they can bombard it with
high energy RFI.  :-)

A 1 of 4 decoder need not be the same as a 1 to 4 demultiplexer, although
many commercial SSI implementations allow you to use one as such. Strictly,
a 1 of 4 decoder need only take two lines in and make one output change
state, according to the inputs.

A demux, on the other hand, uses two control inputs to determine which
of four outputs will reflect the state of the input signal. So there are
three inputs required.

A decoder can be used as a demux if it is equipped with an output enable
input, since this can be used as the data input (e.g. when high, all
outputs are high; when low, only the selected (by control inputs) output
will be low).

An eight way decoder is created by using the high order bit (bit 2) to
select which of two four way demuxes is enabled. Thus you achieve your
aim of having only one output of eight reflecting the input bits. Note
that this method cannot be used to create a true eight way demux, since
you have no data input (the enable line on a four way decoder) left
once you commit the enable lines to their intended purpose.

A sixteen way decoder obviously requires four, four-way decoders, plus
a mechanism to enable only one of the four at a time. Therefore, use
the fifth decoder, attached to the two high order bits, to provide the
four enable lines.

Of course, the two low order bits must be connected in parallel to the
four final stage decoders.

Please give me the credit when you submit your homework.

        Since I'm not all too keen on this area of hooking them up, I'm 
asking for help.  I know better than to hook a 12v, 1a stepper line to 
one, unless it can take it; however what about if I've got a 24-60v 
stepper.  What sort of curent limmiting circuitry would be involved (a 
small schematic would probably be helpfull).  
        Also, I've looked into the TIPC2701N by TI, and I was wondering 
if I should use the same suggested (by you replying to this message) 
current limiting circuitry on each of the 7 mosfets in the package as 
that illustrated in the schematic (which you the replyer would hopefully 
help me with).
 
                                ... hmm... different request...

Right. So all the cops will be buying antique muscle cars for chase cars;

Summary: help!!!
Distribution: world
Organization: Memphis State University
Lines: 28

  This may sound like a simple-minded question, but this is the first time
I've ever had a need for this:

I've been designing some relatively simple chip circuits based on things
like photoresistors (you know, no light to photoresistor, emit a logic
high, etc.).

Anyway, I've got some servos lying around, and I wanted to do some things
with them using digital logic.  I know all about having to pulse the signal
and everything, I just have one problem:  I'm assuming I need a negative
(yes, negative) logic high to get the thing to turn in the direction 
opposite the direction it would turn under normal logic high.

Is a negative logic high (I've seen this in schematics) the same thing as
an active low, or what?  I'm not using a bi-polar power source, so how
would I get a negative logic high out of this thing?  I need to have all
three signals available:  Logic high, logic low, and negative logic high.

Any help would be greatly appreciated.  Also, please reply via email, as I
never seem to have time to read this (or any other) group lately.

Thanks much,

Here's the scoop.  When you get your home brew receiver working, would
you be willing to share it with the rest of us?  I always wanted to
build my own but never have the time to fool around and design it.

pin 1:  signal ground
pin 2:  signal
pin 3:  always hot +6 volts
pin 4:  +6 volts, hot only when preamp is turned on
pin 5:  infrared repeater connectors

The infrared repeater jacks on the back of the preamp are not connected
to anything inside the preamp except the 5 pin connector pin #5.  There
is a 150 ohm resistor between the two jacks, with a 1.5K from pin 5 to
ground.

The signal pin #2 in the preamp is summed with the built in IR receiver.
They use a chip called CX20106A and a BJT to amplify the signal.  I would
imagine the logical way would be to duplicate this circuit and use
it as the external receiver.

If you need more info, let me know.

If you see a 8551 made by MOS or CSG, take it, its a 6551A.

I know no fixed version of the 6551. There are different possibilities
to work around this bug. The easiest is to tie _CTS to GND and
use _DSR or _DCD as _CTS. It should be easy to fix the software,
_DSR is bit 6 and DCD ist bit 5 of the Status Register (Read 6551
with RS1 = low and RS0 = high).

Using the _CTS-line can lead into big trouble. The 6551 _instantly_
stops transmission if _CTS goes high. This means, that you may
get only a half byte...

What do you mean "more comfortable putting it up to."  That seems a bit
hard to evaluate.  At least for me it is.  

Stare straight Point with both hands together and clasp so that only the
pointer fingers are pointing straight forward to a a spot on the wall about
eight feet away.  First stare at the spot with both eyes open.  Now
close your left eye.  Now open your left eye.  Now close your right eye.
now open your right eye.

If the image jumped more when you closed your right eye, you are right
eye dominant.

If the image jumped more when you closed your left eye, you are left eye
dominant.

As nobody in the food industry has even bothered to address my previous
question "WHY DO YOU NEED TO PUT MSG IN ALMOST EVERY FOOD?" I must assume
that my wife's answer is closer to the truth than I hoped it was.

She believes that MSG is added to food to cause people to eat more of it
and not quit when they shoud be sated.  To put it a different way, she 
believes that for some people MSG causes them to act toward food like an addict.  
(Eat all the chips, chow down on several packages of noodle soup .... you get the
idea! }  IF she is right, then the moral and ethical standards of the 
food, chemical and regulatory groups need to be addressed!!!  Can MSG
be considered a conditioning substance (not addictive but sort of habit
forming) ?

This brings up a side question of mine.   I have noticed that cats (my
children's and my parent's) seem to fixate on a particular brand of pet
food. The cat will eat any product within one brand and not any other
brand.  I have wondered if this is not a case of preference, but, some
sort of chemical training or addiction. My questions, for the net, are:
Does the FDA regulate the contents of pet food?  Is it allowed for pet
food to contain addictive or conditioning substances?  Is MSG put in 
pet food?

The proper spelling is Kirlian. It was an effect discoverd by
S. Kirlian, a soviet film developer in 1939.

As I recall, the coronas visible are ascribed to static discharges
and chemical reactions between the organic material and the silver
halides in the films.

This, simply stated, is a result of the bankrupt ethics in
the healthcare and scientific medicine industries.

America is fed up with the massive waste and fraud that is costing
us 15% of our GNP to support these industries, while delivering 
marginal health care to the community.

Unfortunately, the "Clinton Plan", in whatever form it
takes, will probably cost us an even greater sum.  Bleah.

YES!

I call this notion "psychological health food" and, in fact, have
determined that the Four Food Groups are Ice Cream, Pizza, Barbecue, and
Chocolate.  Ideally, every meal should contain something from at least two
of these four groups.  Food DOES serve functions other than nutrition, and
one of them is keeping the organism happy and thus aiding its immune
system. 

And I didn't spend a million bucks commissioning a study that told me to
redraw my silly little pyramid in different colors and with a friendlier
typeface, either.  (Ref: Consumer Reports' back page--one of the best
things ever to turn up there.)

Rich Young <young@serum.kodak.com> writes of one of six impossible things:

DM> No matter how much I eat, it still seems realistic.

Yeah, I want to try one of those 42oz steaks (cooked over applewood) at
Wally's Wolf Lodge Inn in Coeur d'Alene.  That seems quite
unrealistic--unrealistically SMALL.  And a few slabs of ribs from the East
Texas Smoker (RIP, again) in Louisville is not at all unrealistic either.  

What say we have a rec.food.cooking dinner at the Moonlite Bar-B-Que Inn in
Owensboro? (It's all you can eat including lamb ribs & mutton for about
$10.)  We could invite Julie Kangas as guest of honor and see if the
Moonlite's Very Hot Sauce is too hot for her.  (It IS too hot for me, and I
don't say that very often.)  And she could bring ice cream with crushed
dried chiltepins for dessert.  

And we could see if there IS such a thing as an "unrealistically large
quantity" of barbecue--the owner of the Moonlite estimates that the
Owensboro restaurants serve a hundred thousand pounds of meat a week in the
summer, and forty thousand in the winter--in a town of 50 000 or so.  Two
pounds per person per week?   Again, sure sounds unrealistic to me--thats
just too meager to be healthy.

If you can get it, you might want to try a Canadian over-the-counter product
called Secaris, which is a water-soluble gel.  Compared to Vaseline or other
greasy ointments, Secaris seems more compatible with the moisture that's
already there.

Frequently of late, I have been reacting to something added to
restaurant foods.  What happens is that the inside of my throat starts
to feel "puffy", like I have a cold, and also at times the inside of my
mouth (especially the tongue) and lips also feel puffy.

The situations around these symptoms almost always involve restaurants
(usually chinese), the most notable cases:  a cheap chinese fast food
chain, a japanese steak house (I had the steak), and another chinese
fast food chain where I SAW the cook put about a tablespoon or two of
what looked like sugar or salt into my fried rice.

I am under the impression that MSG "enhances" flavor by causing the
taste buds to swell.  If this is correct, I do not find it unreasonable
to assume that high doses of MSG can cause other mouth tissues to swell.

Also, as the many of the occurances (including two of the above)
involved beef, and as beef is frequently tenderized with MSG, this is
what I suspect as being the cause.

I wouldn't be at all surprised if toxicity studies of MSG in animals
showed it as being harmless, as it would be very startling to hear a lab
rat or rhesus monkey complain about their throats feeling funny.

Anyone who wishes to explain how the majority of food additives are
totally harmless is welcome to e-mail me with the results of any studied
they know of.  I will probably respond to them however with a reminder
of how long it took to prove that smoking causes cancer (which the
tobacco companies still deny).

(If I sound grumpy, it's because I had beef with broccoli for lunch
today, and now it hurts to swallow)

I think a case could be made that this is discriminatory, particularly
if an applicant had good board scores and recommendations but wasn't
offered an interview, but I don't know if it has ever gone to court.

Crullerian photography isn't educational, except in a purely satiric

Crullerian photography involves putting donuts between grease-covered
hot metal plates while illuminating them with a Krypton Stroboscope.
Through a unique iteration involving the 4th-dimensional projection of
a torus through the semi-stochastic interactions of hot monomolecular
lipid layers covering the metal plates (the best metal is iron since
it repels Vampires and Succubi) the donuts start developing flutes,
and within moments actually become poly-crenellated hot greasy
breadtubes. Some people believe that food is the way to a man's heart,
but most psychics agree that there is nothing like hot Crullers for
breakfast; the chemical composition of crullers is a mystery, some
thought evidence of Charles Fort's channeling in Stevie Wonder's
production of "The Secret Life of Plants" when played backwards in the
theatre of unnaturally fertile Findhorn Farms has deduced that they
are complex carbohydrates ordinarily only found by spectoscopy in the
Magellenic Clouds. I called Devi on my Orgone Box and asked her if
this was really the case, and she TM levitated me a letter across the
Atlantic to tell me it was indeed not just another case of
misunderstanding Tesla, though the Miskatonic University hasn't
confirmed anything at all. At least the Crullers taste good; I got the
recipe from Kaspar Hauser.

 How about Kirlian imaging ? I believe the FAQ for sci.skeptics (sp?)
 has a nice write-up on this. They would certainly be most supportive
 on helping you to build such a device and connect to a 120Kvolt
 supply so that you can take a serious look at your "aura"... :-)

Candida albicans can cause severe life-threatening infections, usually
in people who are otherwise quite ill.  This is not, however, the sort
of illness that you are probably discussing.

"Systemic yeast syndrome" where the body is allergic to
yeast is considered a quack diagnosis by mainstream medicine.  There
is a book "The Yeast Connection" which talks about this "illness".

There is no convincing evidence that such a disease exists.

I was under the (possibly incorrect) assumption that most of the MSG on
our foods was made from processing sugar beets. Is this not true? Are 
there other sources of MSG?

I am one of those folx who react, sometimes strongly, to MSG. However,
I also react strongly to sodium chloride (table salt) in excess. Each
causes different symptoms except for the common one of rapid heartbeat
and an uncomfortable feeling of pressure in my chest, upper left quadrant.

	The reason I'm posting this article to this newsgroup is to:
1. gather any information about this disorder from anyone who might
   have recently been *e*ffected by it ( from being associated with
   it or actually having this disorder ) and
2. help me find out where I can access any medical literature associated
   with seizures over the internet.

Recently, I had a baby boy born with seizures which occured 12-15 hours
after birth. He was immediately transferred to a major hospital in Boston
and has since been undergoing extensive drug treatment for his condition.
This has been a major learning experience for me and my wife not only in
learning the medical problems that faced our son but also in dealing with
hospitals, procedures...etc.

I don't want to go into a lot of detail, but his condition was termed 
quite severe at first then slowly he began to grow and put on weight
as a normal baby would. He was put on the standard anti-convulsion drugs
and that did not seem to help out. His MRI, EKG, cat-scans are all normal,
but the EEG's show alot of seizure activity. After many metabolic tests,
body structure tests, and infection/virus tests the doctors still do not
know quite what type of siezures he is having (although they do have alot
of evidence that it is now pointing to infantile spasms ). This is where
we stand right now....

If anyone knows of any database or newsgroup or as I mentioned up above,
any information relating to this disorder I would sure appreciate hearing
from you. I am not trying to play doctor here, but only trying to gather
information about it. As I know now, these particular types of disorders
are still not really well understood by the medical community, and so I'm
going to see now....if somehow the internet can at least give me alittle
insight. Thanks.

There's a lot of evidence, it just hasn't been adequately gathered and
published in a way that will convince the die-hard melancholic skeptics
who quiver everytime the word 'anecdote' or 'empirical' is used.

For example, Dr. Ivker, who wrote the book "Sinus Survival", always gives,
before any other treatment, a systemic anti-fungal (such as Nizoral) to his
new patients IF they've been on braod-spectrum anti-biotics 4 or more times
in the last two years.  He's kept a record of the results, and for over 
2000 patients found that over 90% of his patients get significant relief
of allergic/sinus symptoms.  Of course, this is only the beginning for his
program.

In my case, as I reported a few weeks ago, I was developing the classic
symptoms outlined in 'The Yeast Connection' (I agree it is a poorly 
written book):  e.g., extreme sensitivity to plastics, vapors, etc. which
I never had before (started in November).  Within one week of full dosage
of Sporanox, the sensitivity to chemicals has fully disappeared - I can
now sit on my couch at home without dying after two minutes.  I'm also
*greatly* improved in other areas as well.

Of course, I have allergy symptoms, etc.  I am especially allergic to
molds, yeasts, etc.  It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that
if one has excessive colonization of yeast in the body, and you have a
natural allergy to yeasts, that a threshold would be reached where you
would have perceptible symptoms.  Also, yeast do produce toxins of various
sorts, and again, you don't have to be a rocket scientist to realize that
such toxins can cause problems in some people.  In my case it was sinus
since that's the center of my allergic response.  Of course, the $60,000
question is whether a person who is immune compromised (as tests showed I was
from over 5 years of antibiotics, nutritionally-deficiencies because of the
stress of infections and allergies, etc.), can develop excessive yeast
colonization somewhere in the body.  It is a tough question to answer since
testing for excessive yeast colonization is not easy.  One almost has to
take an empirical approach to diagnosis.  Fortunately, Sporanox is relatively
safe unlike past anti-fungals (still have to be careful, however) so there's
no reason any longer to withhold Sporanox treatment for empirical reasons.

BTW, some would say to try Nystatin.  Unfortunately, most yeast grows hyphae
too deep into tissue for Nystatin to have any permanent affect.  You'll find
a lot of people who are on Nystatin all the time.

In summary, I appreciate all of the attempts by those who desire to keep
medicine on the right road.  But methinks that some who hold too firmly
to the party line are academics who haven't been in the trenches long enough
actually treating patients.  If anybody, doctors included, said to me to my
face that there is no evidence of the 'yeast connection', I cannot guarantee
their safety.  For their incompetence, ripping off their lips is justified as
far as I am concerned.

Here in Georgia, the state legislature in 1992 "accidentally passed a law 
lobbied for by Opthamologists prohibiting anyone but a licensed MD from
giving shots. They were trying to limit Optometrists from competing with
them.
They inadvertantly forbade nurses, EMTs, dentists, and tattoo artists 
from "piercing the skin." (probably diabetics too). The Secretary of State's 
office announced on June 30th that they wouldn't enforce it pending
reconsideration in the 1003 Legislature. In the hassle over the state flag
I heard nothing about repealing it.

       Non-toxic tear gas?!?  Do you know what tear gas is?

       I do: once upon a time I happened to be in a room when someone threw 
       a tear-gas grenade in (that was supposed to be a joke:).  The sensation 
       was incredible: I felt my eyes and nostrils were being torn apart.
       I remember us - a bunch of young men in our early 20's - running out
       like a herd of wild animals, knocking down the door and jumping
       out of the windows (thank G-d we were on the first floor).

       I can't imagine this kind of stuff being used against children.

For them, the worst effect might not be the physical effects so much
as the psychological effect of being incapacitated without fully
understanding the cause.  Many years ago, I was accidentally exposed
to a tiny dose of tear gas.  (It was in Athens, on the street leading
to the American Embassy; there'd been a march that had been broken up
with tear-gas; I must have stumbled into a remaining patch of gas the
next day.)  Aside from the tears, feeling sick to my stomach, etc.,
the really horrible psychological effect was that of suddenly falling
to pieces and not knowing why it had happened---I was horrified and
wondered what disease or other health problem I had.  (I didn't find
out about the march and the tear-gas till hours later.)  I can imagine
how horribly disorienting this might be to very young children:
suddenly crying uncontrollably and feeling sick, weak, and out of
control of your body---and not knowing the cause.

``This gives us a chance to try the Gas of Peace.''  Yeah, right.

Such as?  Not being able to get married isn't a roadblock to a permanent
relationship.  Lack of a marriage certificate doesn't force a couple
to break up.  This is an excuse used by homosexuals because the 
alternative is to ask why they are so much more promiscuous than 
straights.

Yes you are.  When you and the rest of the homosexual community
pass laws to impose your moral codes on me, by requiring me to
hire, rent to, or otherwise associate with a homosexual against
my will, yes, you are in my face.  Until homosexuals stop trying
to impose their morals on me, I will be in your face about this.

Do they have a history of working in massage parlors, and telling
co-workers there that they are prostitutes?  Do they frequent truck
stop parking lots at 4:00 AM, without ID on any sort?

    James Madison, Federalist Paper 41:

    "It has been urged and echoed, that the power ``to lay and
     collect taxes, duties, imposts, and excises, to pay the debts,
     and provide for the common defense and general welfare of the
     United States,'' amounts to an unlimited commission to exercise
     every power which may be alleged to be necessary for the common
     defense or general welfare...

    "No stronger proof could be given of the distress under which
     these writers labor for objections, than their stooping to such a
     misconstruction.  Had no other enumeration or definition of the
     powers of the Congress been found in the Constitution, than the
     general expressions just cited, the authors of the objection
     might have had some color for it; ...  But what color can the
     objection have, when a specification of the objects alluded to by
     these general terms immediately follows, and is not even
     separated by a longer pause than a semicolon?  ...  Nothing is
     more natural nor common than first to use a general phrase, and
     then to explain and qualify it by a recital of particulars.

We were having a discussion about whether Bush would have done anything
differently. On the basis of Panama, Grenada, Tripoli, Kewait etc we 
decided that Bush would have asked for a surgical airstrike  or used a 
cruise missile, some people suggested that he would have used the nuke

The person who murdered 17 children was Koresh. He kept them there and 
brought about their deaths deliberately.

You may consider that I am a complete bastard and a not very nice chap.
Thats quite true. I don't pretend to be. Being nice is what amateurs
try to do. If you want to talk politics you are talking hard decisions
such as whether the lives of the troops should be risked attempting
to rescue the children. Anyone who has held the office of President
of the United States since FDR has held the threat that if the USA
or its allies were to be threatened then the USA would risk nuclear 
Holocaust in order to protect freedom. Beleive it or not, that is not
the sort of threat that nice chaps make. Do they have a gun nutters
section of the US version of CND by any chance?


There are cases where society has to be protected from
madmen such as Koresh or Hitler. If it were not for the consideration
of the 17 children in there the question of the tactics to be used would
not be a matter of anything but academic significance. It is not for
the govt to prevent people from commiting mass suicide.

The latest reports are that cult members were shot attempting to
leave the compound by Koresh loyalists during the fire. If proven
that would entail the final nail in the coffin of those who want to
promote Koresh as some sort of role model or hero.


I need hardly add that it is Koresh that has created the Holocaust in
this case by the deliberate arson of the ranch appocalypse.

addressing issues around reauthorization of Chapter 1; how
paraprofessionals and school-related personnel, especially
minority men, can serve as student role models; the increasing
problem of school violence; dealing with abused children; and

I guess my news reader deleted the lines of the 4th amendment which deal
with no-knock warrants.  How do you deduce that they are in clear violation?
Now maybe no-knock warrants SHOULD be illegal.  But until the Supreme Court
says so, your own pronouncements on the warrant's constitutionality are just
wishful thinking.

	Excuse me? Quality? As in grade A CO2 and grade B CO2? I may not have
this quite right but I was under the impression that CO2 was CO2.

 Furthermore,

	A) There is no reason to believe this system is inherently stable- 
The Ice ages occured without any help from humans.

	B) The point was that the human contribution of CO2 and other 
greenhouse gasses is insignificant and it won't really make a difference if
we make more or less.

	C) What overwhelming data? I see lots of 'projections' of the future,
which is fascinating, considering they can't predict the weather two weeks
in advance.

BULLSHIT. How many lakes have ceased to be able to support life from
purely natural pollution? Man has already done this to scores of lakes.
Also, much of the "degredation" you cite was done by cows and pigs.

And why do think there are so many cows around?

Could it be.......cause people raise them?

I have evidence that you will not accept that proves to me that God
exists.  I have my personal experiences that have proven to me time
and again that God does exist.  My life has not been a bed of roses
and He has been there for me when no one else was around and pulled
me through those times.  Of course, I know this means nothing to you
because it didn't happen to you.  I can't prove to you that God
exists anymore than you can prove that He doesn't.

It ultimately boils down to faith.  Whether or not you believe in
God is a matter strictly between you and Him.  I am just the messenger.
I don't judge and I don't condemn you for not accepting God.  That is
not my place.  You are not my enemy.  Satan is our common enemy.  And
the only way we can defeat Satan is through Jesus Christ.

He fulfilled the prophesies told about Him.  He performed miracles.
You know, healing the sick and ressurrecting the dead.  Jesus died
and rose from the dead just as He said He would.  He preached that
we should love God and love one another as we do ourselves.  Jesus
put into practice that which He preached.  And He rose from the
dead!  His spirit now lives in me.  He changed the world not through
the use of a sword that cleaves the flesh but the Word of God that
cleaves us from sin.

Compare this to DK who made promises of surrendering and then balked
when his deluded predictions didn't come to pass.  In the end, he 
chose to kill himself and everyone with him to hide the shame of 
being a false Messiah.

Jesus allowed himself to be killed in order to fulfill prophecy.  As
you may recall on the Mount of Olives, Jesus prayed to God that if this
fate could have been avoided He would have taken it.  But instead,
out of love for mankind, Jesus chose to accept the agonizing sentence
placed upon Him and thus redeem all mankind.  Jesus died to save 
everyone, even those who crucifed Him.  He's already gone to Hell and
back for you and for me.  All He asks is your love.

Which followers do you refer to?  There have been many who have used
His name to further their own gains.  They would have done the same
even if there was no Jesus in the first place.  For example, Bush 
claimed that God was on their side when they attacked Iraq and Saddam
claimed to have God on his side when he invaded Kuwait.  IMO, God
would have nothing to do with either side.  They were fighting over
oil, plain and simple.
 
God be with you,

You have perhaps heard of the Dead Sea.  I may be wrong, but I believe
it is not misnamed.  And I don't believe that humans had a hand in it,
although it is possible since the great cedar forests of Lebanon were
but a memory by the time of Christ if not earlier.

But, more on the point, while Nature is the may be the more prolific
"despoiler", Man is certainly the more creative.  We have to our
credit pesticides and heavy metals, not to mention radioactivity,
which is so wonderfully persistent and fatal (not that we invented
radioactivity or heavy metals, we only concentrated them so that they
would be a more lethal threat).

In general I find Mr. Bacon's arguments rhetorical, devoid of sense,
and therefore trivial.

BTW, is there any reason this discussion is on phl.misc?

So long,

The FBI says that one survivor says they set the fire themselves.

Given that the claim is that the fire was started in 3 places at once,
and that the building was being rammed by a tank and filled with tear
gas, just how did the Davidians manage to co-ordinate such a thing?

A "moment of silence" doesn't mean much unless *everyone*
participates.  Otherwise it's not silent, now is it?

Non-religious reasons for having a "moment of silence" for a dead
classmate: (1) to comfort the friends by showing respect to the
deceased , (2) to give the classmates a moment to grieve together, (3)
to give the friends a moment to remember their classmate *in the
context of the school*, (4) to deal with the fact that the classmate
is gone so that it's not disruptive later.

Blindly opposing everything with a flavor of religion in it is
utterly idiotic.

Did anyone say the world existed forever, never was created, and has an
endless supply of energy?

Also, there are lots of people like myself who don't think that the spon-
taneous generation of life from non-life is such an incredible event, given
a billion years or so for it to take place.
#undef rant_mode

"Imaginative thinking" probably isn't the right thing to ask.  The thing is,
as you no doubt have already been told, that Genesis 1 does not constitute
a scientific theory.  Given a scientific theory of the origin of the universe
or earth or anything else, we can decide what sort of things we expect to be
true about today's universe.  What predictions does Genesis 1 make about
today's universe that disagree with the standard "scientific" version,
and how can we test them?

If this is what you want to do, keep in mind that, despite the considerable
length of time t.o has existed, no one has yet succeeded.

It is true that Mormons believe that all spirits (including Jesus,
Lucifer, Robert Weiss) are in the same family.  It does not mean
that Jesus was created, but rather that Lucifer and Robert Weiss
were not.  I agree that this is a "heresy".  So what?  
The sweating of blood in Gethsemene is
not a basic Mormon doctrine.  Jesus did not perform the atonement
in Getheseme alone, as some anti-Mormons are trying to teach.  
As far as the "unpardonable sin" whatever that is, it is Biblical,
and not specifically Mormon.  It is also called the sin against
the Holy Ghost.  Most Bible scholars (other than conservative
ones) do not believe Jehovah and Elohim were always the same.
I'm sure you've heard of the J and the E texts?  I don't
know what you mean by "That He needed to be saved".  Jesus?
Jehovah?  Elohim?  In Mormon doctrine, Jesus was sinless,
and thus did not "need to be saved".

In two places at once? Bit of a coincidence, that.

Whatever the faults the FBI had, the fact is that responsibility
for those deaths lies with Koresh.

Let me clarify.  In order to more clearly understand scripture, one must
look in the context of where the verse is found.  The section you refer
to here is found in Luke 22.  I'd like to start back at verse 35 and I'll
include it here for the sake of completeness:

   Then Jesus asked them, "When I sent you without purse, bag or sandals,
   did you lack anything?"
   "Nothing." the disciples replied.

Verse 36 says:  "But now, if you have a purse take it and also a bag; and
    if you don't have a sword, sell your cloak and buy one.  It is written,
    "And he was numbered with the transgressors."

Verse 38 says:  The disciples said, "See, Lord, here are two swords."
                "That is enough."  he replied.

What does this all mean?
 
In verse 35, Jesus points out to the disciples that when he sent them out
previously, they did not need to take anything with them.  Their food,
lodging and transport were often provided through the generosity of others.
If verse 36, Jesus alludes to the change in attitude that is to come in the
near future.  Remember, Jesus was saying these things shortly before he was
to be arrested.  In verse 36, He tells the disciples that they will have
to take their own possessions and provisions with them.  THey will have to
carry their own purse because there will be no longer any generosity from
anyone.  And there will be times of peril when they will have to take care
of themselves.  This was implied by the reference to the sword.  Jesus knew
that He was going to be arrested and labeled as a criminal.  The charges
brought against Him were likely to be passed on to his disciples.

In verse 38, we see that the disciples have taken Jesus too literally.  It is
not the first time that the disciples got His message wrong.  They had done 
this on several occassions.  Instead of understanding the gist of His words,
they presented Him with two swords.  Jesus was perhaps taken aback by
this promptly concludes the discussion by saying, "That is enough."

The disciples could not understand why Jesus had to die.  Jesus kept telling
them over and over again that He would soon not be with them but they could
not grasp this.  They wanted their Messiah to be a political leader who would
lead them in rebellion against the Romans.  That is why they were so keen on
presenting Him with the swords.  They had no idea that Jesus was referring to
a different kingdom of which they were to be a part of.  The disciples could
only perceive of a kingdom on earth rather than the one in Heaven.

Understand that Jesus NEVER intended his followers to take up arms in rebellion.
This was clearly in evidence in Luke 22:51 when Jesus rebuked his disciples for 
using the sword against the servant of the high priest when they came to arrest 
Him.  As further evidence, Jesus goes so far as to heal the man injured by the disciples.  Jesus did NOT condone violence as a means for His purpose.

Contrast this behaviour with that of David Koresh and you will clearly see that
DK was NOT Jesus as he claimed.  Jesus surrendered himself to the authourities
and allowed himself to be crucified.  He didn't go out in a blaze of glory, but
rather Jesus was executed like a common criminal.  

I hope this makes it a little more clear.

God be with you,

And does it not say in scripture that no man knows the hour of His coming, not
even the angels in Heaven but only the Father Himself?  DK was trying to play
God by breaking the seals himself.  DK killed himself and as many of his
followers as he could.  BTW, God did save the children.  They are in Heaven,
a far better place.  How do I know?  By faith.

God be with you,

That some results are not "objective" means neither that all results are
non-objective, nor that "physics" is non-objective.

Some of these "cults", which seems like a rather dismissive term
to me, are pretty big here in the USA.  Most of them
are quite respectable & neiborly & do not resemble Branch Davidians
in the least; confusing them is a mistake.  What about "live &
let live", folks?  I'm sure we can uncover a few extremist loonies
who are Catholic -- the anti-abortion movement in the USA seems to have a
few hard cases in it, for example.

I have to agree Matthew with this; I have certainly encountered a lot
of anti-Catholic-religion propaganda & emotion (& some bigotry) from
members of certain religious groups here.  They also practice their
missionary work with zeal among Catholics in the United States, but to
someone who is or was raised Catholic such rhetoric is pretty
off-putting.  It may work better in an environment where there's a lot
of popular anti-clericalism.

Follow-ups set elsewhere, this no longer seems very relevant to Celtic issues
to me.

Not necessarily. It is much the same problem as the Eve hypothesis. If
all, or most, of the copies that were available when printing became
common were decended from the same copy, a change in that copy would
propagate to all modern copies, even if there were other copies in 
existence at the time of the change. Very few libraries would have
duplicates of a non-religious book, so there would be few opportunities
for anyone to notice that there were variations. Even if someone did
notice, they would be more likely to copy the variation that conformed
to their expectations and ignore the others.

	There are actually a few important things we can glean from this mess:
1)	When they start getting desperate for an answer to the question: "What's
it all about. Mr. Natural?", pinkboys will buy darn near *anything*, which
means:
2)	There's still plenty of $$$$ to be made in the False Jesus business
by enterprising SubGenii.  Just remember that:
3)	Once you've separated the pinks from their green, don't blow it all
on automatic weapons from Mexico.  Put it in a Swiss bank account.  Smile a
lot.  Have your flunkies hand out flowers in airports.  The Con will just
shrug you off as long as:
4)	You never, never, NEVER start to believe your own bulldada!  If
"David Koresh" hand't started swallowing his own "apocalypso now" crap, he'd
be working crossword puzzles in the Bahamas today instead of contributing to
the mulch layer in Waco.  This is because:
5)	When you start shooting at cops, they're likely to shoot back.  And 
most of 'em are better shots than you are.

	In short:
	- P.T. Barnum was right 
		and
	- Stupidity is self-correcting
Thus endeth the lesson.

I think you are using the wrong analogy.  A better one would be:
you see some elves.  I don't.  Where is the burden of proof there?

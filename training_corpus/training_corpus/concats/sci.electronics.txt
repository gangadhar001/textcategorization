A method which will directly (almost) provide you with the information that
you require is that which is commonly used for coordinate measurements of 
human body landmarks (eg. the SELSPOT system by SELSPOT AB, Sweden, and the
WATSMART System ??).  These use lateral photoeffect detectors [Lindholm and
Oberg, 1974; Woltring and Marsolais, 1980] to determine the position of a
spot of light projected (using a camera lens) over its surface.  In escence,
the detector is a large photodiode with four cathodes (one on each of the
four sides of the square detector crystal) and a single anode (the back of
the crystal).  A spot of light will produce currents which are proportional
to the position of the spot on the detector's face.  Let's try some ASCII
graphics in 2-D (so the detector has two cathodes to detect linear position)

If the dot of light from the LED is the ONLY source of light, then the position
of the projection is given by this circuit regardless of the level of illumina-
tion (the divider is used to normalize relative to total received power).  When
this circuit is used in the presence of other sources of light, then the way of
"tuning" to it is to sample for a few msec the background signal, light the LED
for an equal time and sample that signal separately.  The difference between
the two is the position of the LED.

Hamamatsu photonics sells linear and 2-D lateral photoeffect detectors, and
they also sell the required signal processing electronics.  The ready-made
systems by SELSPOT and others are NOT cheap ... 

Lindholm, L.E., and K.E. Oberg, "An Optoelectronic Instrument for Remote
On-Line Movement Monitoring", Biotelemetry, 1, 94-95, 1974.

Woltring, H.J., and E.B. Marsolais, "Opto-Electronic (SELSPOT) Gait Measure-
ments in Two and Three Dimensional Space - A Preliminary Report", Bull. Pros-
thetics Research, 46-52, 1980.

Most probably this technique can provide you with a much more accurate
measurement than you need, but I think that its simplicity beats scanning
a quadrant detector with a pan/tilt system until you reach zero difference.

I am looking for information on infra red based position encoders.

The idea would be to bounce the infrared source off a wall and the device would
read out the distance.

preferable it would be rs-232 addressable.



Any leads?

One of the easiest, and really very used ways of copyprotection, is to mark 
a specific sector on the installation disk bad. This is very easy to get 
around, though, if you have any knowledge of hw-hacking, but most 'normal' 
users (yes those lowly key-punchers) don't. Whatever you do, please do

I don't want to get into a semantic argument, but contrary to some other
postings "near UV light" /is/ "actual UV light."  The "near" means that
it is close to the visible spectrum (i.e. of relatively long wavelength),
not that it is "nearly UV."  (I'm sure you can figure out now just what
"far UV" is.)

Regular incandenscent flashlight bulbs emit tiny amounts of UV in the
near end of the spectrum, such that a filter can be used to remove the
visible light and thus create a weak UV source.  Stronger sources are
going to require gas (probably mercury vapor) discharge tubes (such as
fluorescent tubes with UV phosphor).  Be careful, though; strong UV
sources can cause physiological damage, especially to the eyes.  The
shorter wavelengths are the most dangerous.

It wouldn't project a beam like a flashlight, but replacing the tubes
in a portable fluorescent lantern with UV tubes would be a relatively
cheap way to create a portable source.  It would be bright enough to
be useful, but not dangerously so.

There was a news article a little while ago reporting a type of car (was
it a Volvo?) was found to stall if you used a certain brand/model of cellular
phone in it.  I seem to remember the car was recalled to fix the problem.

Hmmmmm... this has possibilities:
If the police are in pursuit of a vehicle, maybe they can bombard it with
high energy RFI.  :-)

A 1 of 4 decoder need not be the same as a 1 to 4 demultiplexer, although
many commercial SSI implementations allow you to use one as such. Strictly,
a 1 of 4 decoder need only take two lines in and make one output change
state, according to the inputs.

A demux, on the other hand, uses two control inputs to determine which
of four outputs will reflect the state of the input signal. So there are
three inputs required.

A decoder can be used as a demux if it is equipped with an output enable
input, since this can be used as the data input (e.g. when high, all
outputs are high; when low, only the selected (by control inputs) output
will be low).

An eight way decoder is created by using the high order bit (bit 2) to
select which of two four way demuxes is enabled. Thus you achieve your
aim of having only one output of eight reflecting the input bits. Note
that this method cannot be used to create a true eight way demux, since
you have no data input (the enable line on a four way decoder) left
once you commit the enable lines to their intended purpose.

A sixteen way decoder obviously requires four, four-way decoders, plus
a mechanism to enable only one of the four at a time. Therefore, use
the fifth decoder, attached to the two high order bits, to provide the
four enable lines.

Of course, the two low order bits must be connected in parallel to the
four final stage decoders.

Please give me the credit when you submit your homework.

        Since I'm not all too keen on this area of hooking them up, I'm 
asking for help.  I know better than to hook a 12v, 1a stepper line to 
one, unless it can take it; however what about if I've got a 24-60v 
stepper.  What sort of curent limmiting circuitry would be involved (a 
small schematic would probably be helpfull).  
        Also, I've looked into the TIPC2701N by TI, and I was wondering 
if I should use the same suggested (by you replying to this message) 
current limiting circuitry on each of the 7 mosfets in the package as 
that illustrated in the schematic (which you the replyer would hopefully 
help me with).
 
                                ... hmm... different request... 
 
                Thanks.

Right. So all the cops will be buying antique muscle cars for chase cars;
otherwise the *police* cars will die too!

Summary: help!!!
Distribution: world

  This may sound like a simple-minded question, but this is the first time
I've ever had a need for this:

I've been designing some relatively simple chip circuits based on things
like photoresistors (you know, no light to photoresistor, emit a logic
high, etc.).

Anyway, I've got some servos lying around, and I wanted to do some things
with them using digital logic.  I know all about having to pulse the signal
and everything, I just have one problem:  I'm assuming I need a negative
(yes, negative) logic high to get the thing to turn in the direction 
opposite the direction it would turn under normal logic high.

Is a negative logic high (I've seen this in schematics) the same thing as
an active low, or what?  I'm not using a bi-polar power source, so how
would I get a negative logic high out of this thing?  I need to have all
three signals available:  Logic high, logic low, and negative logic high.

Any help would be greatly appreciated.  Also, please reply via email, as I
never seem to have time to read this (or any other) group lately.

Thanks much,
-mark

Here's the scoop.  When you get your home brew receiver working, would
you be willing to share it with the rest of us?  I always wanted to
build my own but never have the time to fool around and design it.

pin 1:  signal ground
pin 2:  signal
pin 3:  always hot +6 volts
pin 4:  +6 volts, hot only when preamp is turned on
pin 5:  infrared repeater connectors

The infrared repeater jacks on the back of the preamp are not connected
to anything inside the preamp except the 5 pin connector pin #5.  There
is a 150 ohm resistor between the two jacks, with a 1.5K from pin 5 to
ground.

The signal pin #2 in the preamp is summed with the built in IR receiver.
They use a chip called CX20106A and a BJT to amplify the signal.  I would
imagine the logical way would be to duplicate this circuit and use
it as the external receiver.

If you need more info, let me know.

I have a Bel-966.
I just looked at the manual yesterday... and it does indeed claim to be
undetectable by RDD's.

No, the 6551A is able to operate in a 2 MHz system, the 6551 can only
take 1 MHz without problems.

If you see a 8551 made by MOS or CSG, take it, its a 6551A.

I know no fixed version of the 6551. There are different possibilities
to work around this bug. The easiest is to tie _CTS to GND and
use _DSR or _DCD as _CTS. It should be easy to fix the software,
_DSR is bit 6 and DCD ist bit 5 of the Status Register (Read 6551
with RS1 = low and RS0 = high).

Using the _CTS-line can lead into big trouble. The 6551 _instantly_
stops transmission if _CTS goes high. This means, that you may
get only a half byte...

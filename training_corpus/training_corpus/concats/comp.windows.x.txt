#I'm trying to write some code that lets me draw lines and do rubber-band
#boxes in Motif/X.  I'm running on an 8-bit display for which I've created a
#colormap and am using almost all of the colors.  I want to draw the lines
#in a drawing area widget -- a widget in which I'm displaying a bitmap using
#XPutImage().  If doesn't matter if the lines I draw interactively stay
#around when the window is refreshed.
#
#Currently, to draw interactively, I begin with:
#
#   /* drawIndex is an colortable index I reserve for the Foreground */
#   /* my_default_bg_color is the color index for the background of my image */
#   palette_colors[drawIndex].red =   palette_colors[my_default_bg_color].red;
#   palette_colors[drawIndex].green = palette_colors[my_default_bg_color].green;
#   palette_colors[drawIndex].blue =  palette_colors[my_default_bg_color].blue;
#   XStoreColors( myDisplay, my_cmap, &palette_colors[DrawIndex], 1);
#   XFlush( myDisplay);
#
#   XSetFunction( myDisplay, gc, GXxor);
#   XSetForeground( myDisplay, gc, drawIndex);
#
#Then to draw I do:
#
#   XDrawLine( myDisplay, XtWindow( drawingArea1), gc, x1, y1, x2, y2);
#   XFlush( myDisplay);
#
#And when I'm all done, to return things to normal I do:
#
#   XSetFunction( myDisplay, gc, GXcopy);
#
#
#What I'd like to happen is for the lines I draw to be the inverse of
#whatever I'm drawing over.  Instead what happens is I get white lines.  If
#the lines are over a white background - nothing shows up.  If the lines are
#over a black area - nothing shows up!  It's very strange.  But the GXxor
#function seems right - since if I do a rubber-banding box, it erases and
#redraws itself correctly (ie. not disturbing the underlying image).
#
#Any suggestions what I'm doing wrong?
#

I believe for this to work on a color display you must set the foreground of
the GC to be (foreground^background).

I have a problem where an Athena strip chart widget is not calling it's
get value function.  I am pretty sure this is happening because I am
not using XtAppMainLoop, but am dealing with events via sockets.  (ya ya).

Anyway, I want to cause a timeout so that the strip chart widget(s) will
call their get value callback.  Or if someone knows another FAST way around
this (or any way for that matter) let me know.  I cannot (or I don't think)
call the XtNgetValue callback myself because I don't have the value for
the third parameter of the get value proc (XtPointer call_data).  

In other words, I want to force a strip chart widget to update itself.

Any ideas anyone?

I need to write an application which does annotation notes
on existing documents.  The annotation could be done several
times by different people.  The idea is something like having
several acetate transparencies stacked on top of each other
so that the user can see through all of them.  I've seen
something like this being done by the oclock client.
Could someone please tell me how to do it in Xt?
Thank you very much.

The shell is waiting for the window-manager to respond to its
positioning request.  The window-manager is not responding because
it thinks the window is already in the right place.

Exactly *why* the two components get into this sulk is unclear to
me; all information greatly received.

Does XDM work with DECnet? I have an Ultrix machine running both TCP/IP
and DECnet. I have a number of X-terminals hanging off the Ultrix host also
running TCP/IP and DECnet. Presently I am using XDM for the login procedure
on the X-terminals using TCP/IP. Since XDM is basically just an X-windows
client, shouldn't I be able to run XDM on the DECnet protocol tower as well?

My first inclination is that XDM is not your typical X client. It is making
TCP/IP specific socket calls. In this case the answer would be no; you can
not run XDM over DECnet. Is this right or not? Any feedback is appreciated.
Thanks.

What it has to do with your original question is this: many times 
beginning X users (heck, experienced X users too!) write small test
programs.  Many times they forget to draw only in response to expose
events, and thus see unpreditable results whereby sometimes the application's
graphics show up, and sometimes they don't.  We're just trying to
eliminate all the "easy" explanations  for why you're not seeing your
graphics. 

That being said, why don't you try copying different planes to your
window other than 16 (== 1 << 4).  Try 1, 1<<1, 1<<2, ..., 1<<7
to see it you get any output.  Since you're dipslaying only a single 
plane of your data, it's possible that all the pixel values in your
pixmap have the same value for that color plane.

I think you are running Xapollo , it's a X11R3 server ...

If you want a X11R4 server you should install PSKQ3 (10.3.5) or 10.4
  so you can run Xdomain .

Hi,

  Please reply to me direct as I am not a member of this list.

  I am new to X, so please excuse my lax (read: "probably incorrect")
terminology!

  Environment: Sun Sparc 10, SunOs 4.1.3.  X11R5 path level 23.  My X process
is started by xdm.

  i) I want to setup the backgroud (root window?) of the tvtwm display to
     display the escherknot etc (grey is a very boring colour to work on)!

     The setup is as follows:

        lib/X11/xdm/Xsetup_0    -   xsetroot -bitmap ... etc
        ~user/.xsession         -   xsetroot .... etc
                                    tvtwm

     There are also .tvtwmrc and .Xdefaults files in the (~user) home
     directory.

     The xsetroot in Xsetup_0 displays the appropriate bitmap in the xdm
     login window as expected - very nice!

     Unfortunately, when the users session is started, the background of the
     tvtwm window reverts to grey.  If I manually type xsetroot... in an
     xterm window when the session has started, the background is changed as
     expected.

     The question is: How do I retain the background from the login window
     and/or specify a new background on a per-user basis as part of the
     the users session startup?

 ii) When I open an Xterm on the Sparc 10, not all of the keys are recognised
     and some keys on the keyboard are not sending the correct characters.

     ie: real key       key shown on screen
         ------------   -------------------
         hash           back slash
         tilde          pipe
         double quote   at symbol
         pound          hash
         cursor key     not recognised

     This is very annoying!  Is X at fault here or the machine setup?  I have
     installed the xterm drivers that came with X11R5 in both terminfo and
     termcap as they seemed more uptodate.

     Typing set in an xterm window shows a terminal type of xterm - as
     expected!

  Any help on how to correct either of these problems much appreciated!

  Thanks,

Dave.

Okay, that's good.  I'm typing this from exactly the same setup.
(US-UNIX layout keyboard)  I did install the sunkbd patch, though.

Make sure you're using "ssetroot", which comes with tvtwm.  When tvtwm
starts up, it nukes the existing root window.  Use an "ssetroot" after
tvtwm starts up.   (You could spawn off a "(sleep 10; ssetroot ...)&")
You can also use "VirtualDesktopBackgroundPixmap filename" or just
VirtualDesktopBackground if you just want another color besides grey.

Did you install the sunkbd patch?  It's in the contrib directory on export.
All the keys on my keyboard send events properly, except the following:
The End, PageUp, PageDown on the 6-key cluster aren't recognized.
Even the compose key works.  (Though I can't seem to get the composed
characters in an xterm to get passed.)

Anyone have a fix for the last two?

The situation: running a Fortran executable that creats an Xterm.  An option
in the menu contained in the Xterm runs a Fortran subroutine that creats
a Tektronics-mode Xterm for displaying some graphics.  Typing a <RET> while
the Tektronics-mode Xterm (future reference to this will be "Tek-term") is
active makes the Xterm read future keystrokes but does not shift input focus
to the Xterm (I'm basing that statement on the fact that the border of the 
Tek-term stays the highlighted color and that the Tek-term stays on top of
Xterm.  If what I'm describing isn't input focus, let me know.)  

The xterm can be brought to the top by clicking the mouse button on it.

Subsequent selections from the Xterm of the menu item that displays graphics 
highlihts the border and displays the updated graphics, but does not move 
the Tek-term to the top.  If the Tek-term has been iconized to conserve 
screen space, it stays an icon.


The desired behavior: one of two options - 

    1. Whichever of the windows that is active is always on top of the 
       inactive one.

    2. Whenever the Tek-term is inactivated, it should revert to a icon
       but when it is activated it should become a window on a higher 
       level than the Xterm.

What I think I need: a means of specifying that a Xterm or Tek-term will
be at the highest level and a way to iconify/expand a Xterm and Tek-term.
These commands, would, I'd guess, need to be in the Fortran or in the 
command that starts up the Xterm and Tek-term.

Other information: All this is taking place on a VT-1300 (a DEC dumb 
X-windows terminal) connected to a VAX running VMS and Motif.

Thanks for your time.  If you've got any words of wisdom (other than 
"give up" ;-), please send email to

You can't make GL calls in an XmDrawingArea widget for sure.

I can vouch for that. The GL Widget works pretty well. I have been using it
for sometime now. I'm not sure though whether you can use Xlib calls to draw
into the GL widget. I haven't tried it yet nor have I read the accompanying
documentation completely. Try posting to comp.sys.sgi for more information.
Better still,you will find most of the answers in the  SGI manuals .. there
is a little transition guide which explains the "mixed-model programming"
paradigm(Mixing X and GL).

: |> Does PEX (graPHIGS?) have the same functionality of GL?

Well, PEX is designed as an extension to  X and will be more seamless  but 
then, it is buggy to start with .. opinions again.

  If you need speed, and your client can run on the same host as the X server,
  you should use the shared memory extension to the sample X server (MIT-SHM).
  xdpyinfo  will tell you if your server has this extension. This is certainly
  available with the sample MIT X server running under SunOS.
  A word of warning: make sure your kernel is configured to support shared
  memory. And another word of warning: OpenWindows is slower than the MIT
  server.
  I have written an imaging tool (using XView for the GUI, by the way) which
  yields over 10 frames per second for 512*512*8 bit images, running on a Sparc
  IPC (half the cpu grunt of an IPX). This has proved quite sufficient for
  animations.

1. You need these resources :
	XTerm*EightBitInput:    true
	XTerm*EightBitOutput:    true

2. In the shell you need to do : 
        stty cs8 -istrip 


Good luck .

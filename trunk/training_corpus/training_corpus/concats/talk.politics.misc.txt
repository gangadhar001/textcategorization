Here in Georgia, the state legislature in 1992 "accidentally passed a law 
lobbied for by Opthamologists prohibiting anyone but a licensed MD from
giving shots. They were trying to limit Optometrists from competing with
them.
They inadvertantly forbade nurses, EMTs, dentists, and tattoo artists 
from "piercing the skin." (probably diabetics too). The Secretary of State's 
office announced on June 30th that they wouldn't enforce it pending
reconsideration in the 1003 Legislature. In the hassle over the state flag
I heard nothing about repealing it.

       Non-toxic tear gas?!?  Do you know what tear gas is?

       I do: once upon a time I happened to be in a room when someone threw 
       a tear-gas grenade in (that was supposed to be a joke:).  The sensation 
       was incredible: I felt my eyes and nostrils were being torn apart.
       I remember us - a bunch of young men in our early 20's - running out
       like a herd of wild animals, knocking down the door and jumping
       out of the windows (thank G-d we were on the first floor).

       I can't imagine this kind of stuff being used against children.

For them, the worst effect might not be the physical effects so much
as the psychological effect of being incapacitated without fully
understanding the cause.  Many years ago, I was accidentally exposed
to a tiny dose of tear gas.  (It was in Athens, on the street leading
to the American Embassy; there'd been a march that had been broken up
with tear-gas; I must have stumbled into a remaining patch of gas the
next day.)  Aside from the tears, feeling sick to my stomach, etc.,
the really horrible psychological effect was that of suddenly falling
to pieces and not knowing why it had happened---I was horrified and
wondered what disease or other health problem I had.  (I didn't find
out about the march and the tear-gas till hours later.)  I can imagine
how horribly disorienting this might be to very young children:
suddenly crying uncontrollably and feeling sick, weak, and out of
control of your body---and not knowing the cause.

``This gives us a chance to try the Gas of Peace.''  Yeah, right.

Such as?  Not being able to get married isn't a roadblock to a permanent
relationship.  Lack of a marriage certificate doesn't force a couple
to break up.  This is an excuse used by homosexuals because the 
alternative is to ask why they are so much more promiscuous than 
straights.

Yes you are.  When you and the rest of the homosexual community
pass laws to impose your moral codes on me, by requiring me to
hire, rent to, or otherwise associate with a homosexual against
my will, yes, you are in my face.  Until homosexuals stop trying
to impose their morals on me, I will be in your face about this.

Do they have a history of working in massage parlors, and telling
co-workers there that they are prostitutes?  Do they frequent truck
stop parking lots at 4:00 AM, without ID on any sort?

    James Madison, Federalist Paper 41:

    "It has been urged and echoed, that the power ``to lay and
     collect taxes, duties, imposts, and excises, to pay the debts,
     and provide for the common defense and general welfare of the
     United States,'' amounts to an unlimited commission to exercise
     every power which may be alleged to be necessary for the common
     defense or general welfare...

    "No stronger proof could be given of the distress under which
     these writers labor for objections, than their stooping to such a
     misconstruction.  Had no other enumeration or definition of the
     powers of the Congress been found in the Constitution, than the
     general expressions just cited, the authors of the objection
     might have had some color for it; ...  But what color can the
     objection have, when a specification of the objects alluded to by
     these general terms immediately follows, and is not even
     separated by a longer pause than a semicolon?  ...  Nothing is
     more natural nor common than first to use a general phrase, and
     then to explain and qualify it by a recital of particulars.

We were having a discussion about whether Bush would have done anything
differently. On the basis of Panama, Grenada, Tripoli, Kewait etc we 
decided that Bush would have asked for a surgical airstrike  or used a 
cruise missile, some people suggested that he would have used the nuke
warhead cruise, others pointed out that he would be too cheap to use 'em.

The person who murdered 17 children was Koresh. He kept them there and 
brought about their deaths deliberately.

You may consider that I am a complete bastard and a not very nice chap.
Thats quite true. I don't pretend to be. Being nice is what amateurs
try to do. If you want to talk politics you are talking hard decisions
such as whether the lives of the troops should be risked attempting
to rescue the children. Anyone who has held the office of President
of the United States since FDR has held the threat that if the USA
or its allies were to be threatened then the USA would risk nuclear 
Holocaust in order to protect freedom. Beleive it or not, that is not
the sort of threat that nice chaps make. Do they have a gun nutters
section of the US version of CND by any chance?


There are cases where society has to be protected from
madmen such as Koresh or Hitler. If it were not for the consideration
of the 17 children in there the question of the tactics to be used would
not be a matter of anything but academic significance. It is not for
the govt to prevent people from commiting mass suicide.

The latest reports are that cult members were shot attempting to
leave the compound by Koresh loyalists during the fire. If proven
that would entail the final nail in the coffin of those who want to
promote Koresh as some sort of role model or hero.


I need hardly add that it is Koresh that has created the Holocaust in
this case by the deliberate arson of the ranch appocalypse.

addressing issues around reauthorization of Chapter 1; how
paraprofessionals and school-related personnel, especially
minority men, can serve as student role models; the increasing
problem of school violence; dealing with abused children; and
assisting children with serious health problems.

I guess my news reader deleted the lines of the 4th amendment which deal
with no-knock warrants.  How do you deduce that they are in clear violation?
Now maybe no-knock warrants SHOULD be illegal.  But until the Supreme Court
says so, your own pronouncements on the warrant's constitutionality are just
wishful thinking.

	Excuse me? Quality? As in grade A CO2 and grade B CO2? I may not have
this quite right but I was under the impression that CO2 was CO2.

 Furthermore,

	A) There is no reason to believe this system is inherently stable- 
The Ice ages occured without any help from humans.

	B) The point was that the human contribution of CO2 and other 
greenhouse gasses is insignificant and it won't really make a difference if
we make more or less.

	C) What overwhelming data? I see lots of 'projections' of the future,
which is fascinating, considering they can't predict the weather two weeks
in advance.

BULLSHIT. How many lakes have ceased to be able to support life from
purely natural pollution? Man has already done this to scores of lakes.
Also, much of the "degredation" you cite was done by cows and pigs.

And why do think there are so many cows around?

Could it be.......cause people raise them?

I have evidence that you will not accept that proves to me that God
exists.  I have my personal experiences that have proven to me time
and again that God does exist.  My life has not been a bed of roses
and He has been there for me when no one else was around and pulled
me through those times.  Of course, I know this means nothing to you
because it didn't happen to you.  I can't prove to you that God
exists anymore than you can prove that He doesn't.

It ultimately boils down to faith.  Whether or not you believe in
God is a matter strictly between you and Him.  I am just the messenger.
I don't judge and I don't condemn you for not accepting God.  That is
not my place.  You are not my enemy.  Satan is our common enemy.  And
the only way we can defeat Satan is through Jesus Christ.

He fulfilled the prophesies told about Him.  He performed miracles.
You know, healing the sick and ressurrecting the dead.  Jesus died
and rose from the dead just as He said He would.  He preached that
we should love God and love one another as we do ourselves.  Jesus
put into practice that which He preached.  And He rose from the
dead!  His spirit now lives in me.  He changed the world not through
the use of a sword that cleaves the flesh but the Word of God that
cleaves us from sin.

Compare this to DK who made promises of surrendering and then balked
when his deluded predictions didn't come to pass.  In the end, he 
chose to kill himself and everyone with him to hide the shame of 
being a false Messiah.

Jesus allowed himself to be killed in order to fulfill prophecy.  As
you may recall on the Mount of Olives, Jesus prayed to God that if this
fate could have been avoided He would have taken it.  But instead,
out of love for mankind, Jesus chose to accept the agonizing sentence
placed upon Him and thus redeem all mankind.  Jesus died to save 
everyone, even those who crucifed Him.  He's already gone to Hell and
back for you and for me.  All He asks is your love.

Which followers do you refer to?  There have been many who have used
His name to further their own gains.  They would have done the same
even if there was no Jesus in the first place.  For example, Bush 
claimed that God was on their side when they attacked Iraq and Saddam
claimed to have God on his side when he invaded Kuwait.  IMO, God
would have nothing to do with either side.  They were fighting over
oil, plain and simple.
 
God be with you,

You have perhaps heard of the Dead Sea.  I may be wrong, but I believe
it is not misnamed.  And I don't believe that humans had a hand in it,
although it is possible since the great cedar forests of Lebanon were
but a memory by the time of Christ if not earlier.

But, more on the point, while Nature is the may be the more prolific
"despoiler", Man is certainly the more creative.  We have to our
credit pesticides and heavy metals, not to mention radioactivity,
which is so wonderfully persistent and fatal (not that we invented
radioactivity or heavy metals, we only concentrated them so that they
would be a more lethal threat).

In general I find Mr. Bacon's arguments rhetorical, devoid of sense,
and therefore trivial.

BTW, is there any reason this discussion is on phl.misc?

So long,
JR

The FBI says that one survivor says they set the fire themselves.

Given that the claim is that the fire was started in 3 places at once,
and that the building was being rammed by a tank and filled with tear
gas, just how did the Davidians manage to co-ordinate such a thing?

If the first rule of humor is never having to say you're sorry then the 
second rule must be never having to explain yourself.  Few things are 
worse that a joke explained.  In spite of this, and because of requests
for me to post my list o' nicknames, I must admit that no such list
exists.  It was simply a plot device, along with me being the keeper
o' the list, to make the obvious play on the last name of Fuller and to
advance the idea that such a list should be made.

I assumed that the ol' timers would recognize it for what it is.  
Nevertheless, how about a list o' nicknames for alt.atheism posters?
If you think of a good one, just post it and see if others like it.
We could start with those posters who annoy us the most, like Bobby or
Bill.

The number of civilian Iraqi deaths were way over-exaggerated and 
exploited for anti-war emotionalism by the liberal news media.  The
facts are that less Iraqis died in the Gulf War than did civilians 
in any other war of comparable size this century!  This was due mostly
to the short duration coupled with precise surgical bombing techniques
which were technically possible only recently.

The idea that "hundreds of thousands" of Iraqi citizens died is
ludicrous.  Not even "hundreds of thousands" of Iraqi soldiers died,
and they were the ones being targeted!  Or do you think that the US
and its allies were specifically out to kill and maim Iraqi civilians?
Either the smart bombs didn't hit their targets (and we know they did),
or they were targeting civilian targets (!) which is hardly condusive to
destroying Iraq's military potential.  The military mission planners are
not fools, they know they have to hit *military* targets to win a war.
Hitting civilian targets does nothing but unite the people against you,
not a laudable goal if one wants the people to rise up against their
tyrant-dictator.

How about all the innocent people who died in blanket-bombing in WW2?
I don't hear you bemoaning them!  War is never an exact science, but
with smart bombs, it's becoming more exact with a smaller percentage
of civilian casualties.  Sometimes mistakes are made; targets are
misidentified; innocents die.  That's war the way it really is.
But the alternative, to allow tyrannical dictators to treat the earth
like it's one big rummage sale, grabbing everything they can get is
worse.  Like Patrick Henry said some 217 years ago, "I know not what
course others may take -- but as for me, give me liberty, or give me
death!"  War is always the price one must be willing to pay if one
wishes to stay free.

Mathew, your sarcasm is noted but you are completely off-base here.
You come off sounding like a complete peace-nik idiot, although I
feel sure that was not your intent.

So the Iraqi war was wrong, eh?  I'm sure that appeasement would have
worked better than war, just like it did in WW2, eh?  I guess we
shouldn't have fought WW2 either -- just think of all those innocent
German civilians killed in Dresden and Hamburg.  How about all the poor 
French who died in the crossfire because we invaded the continent?  We 
should have just let Hitler take over Europe, and you'd be speaking
German instead of English right now.

Tyrants like Hussein *have* to be stopped.  His kind don't understand
diplomacy; they only understand the point of a gun.  My only regret is
that Bush wimped out and didn't have the military roll into Baghdad, so
now Hussein is still in power and the Iraqi people's sacrifice (not to
mention the 357 Americans who died) was for naught.  Liberating Kuwait 
was a good thing, but wiping Hussein off the map would've been better!

And as for poor, poor Rodney King!  Did you ever stop and think *why*
the jury in the first trial brought back a verdict of "not guilty"?
Those who have been foaming at the mouth for the blood of those
policemen certainly have looked no further than the video tape.
But the jury looked at *all* the evidence, evidence which you and I
have not seen.  When one makes a judgment without the benefit of a
trial where evidence can be presented on both sides, one has simply
lowered himself to the level of vigilante justice, a state-of-mind
which your sarcasm above seemingly spoke against, but instead tends
to support in the case against the policemen.  

Law in this country is intended to protect the rights of the accused,
whether they be criminals or cops.  One is not found guilty if there is
a reasonable doubt of one's guilt, and only the jury is in a position
to assess the evidence and render a verdict.  Anyone else is simply
succumbing to verbal vigilantism.

Jim B.

Sure, a person could have great respect for Jesus and yet be an

I would recommend you to take a look at

1) your dictionary
2) alt.atheism FAQ files

to notice that atheism is _not_ a belief system, and what is common
to all atheists is not a belief, but a _lack of belief in deities_.
I cannot imagine how anyone could do research on atheism without
paying careful attention to this issue.

IMHO, this is a poor method to do any real survey, although I'm sure the
replies might keep you amused for hours.

No, I do _not_ know what you mean. If you are surveying our individual
philosophies, fine, but that's not strictly atheism. Atheism is not
just another, godless version of the theistic explanations for life,
the universe and everything. It is not a belief system, and it could
hardly be called a philosophical system.

Once more: Atheism is characterised by lack of belief in deities. 
Do not twist the meaning, or assume that we have some kind of
philosophy we all agree on.

Some comments on your questions:

I would also like to hear more about this. Have we been able to 'convert'
anyone?

> means (proofs of the non-existence of God, etc), or was it perhaps, at least

This question contains a contradiction in terms. _Beliefs_ 
cannot be acquired rationally - if they could, they would not be 
beliefs! You also seem to have rather strange ideas of how people become
atheists - those who are alienated from religion do not necessarily
become atheists, they just think very little about religion. It seems
it requires a considerable time of honest inquiry to find out that
religions are actually intellectually dishonest virtual realities.

Those who have never had beliefs will certainly find this question
quite odd - how can lack of belief be acquired? When did I acquire
lack of belief in the Easter Bunny? (I did believe in Santa, though ;-))

This question does not make any sense, since atheism does not deal with
these issues - it is not a worldview, or a philosophy, or a belief system.

Sigh, why haven't I seen a good, well-thought survey in the Usenet
for three years... and what is the point of doing surveys in the net,
anyway? Just to abstract some opinions?

Not necessarily. It is much the same problem as the Eve hypothesis. If
all, or most, of the copies that were available when printing became
common were decended from the same copy, a change in that copy would
propagate to all modern copies, even if there were other copies in 
existence at the time of the change. Very few libraries would have
duplicates of a non-religious book, so there would be few opportunities
for anyone to notice that there were variations. Even if someone did
notice, they would be more likely to copy the variation that conformed
to their expectations and ignore the others.

Actually, I've got an entire list of books written by various atheist
authors and I went to the largest bookstore in my area (Pittsburgh) and
couldn't find _any_ of them.  What section of the bookstore do you find
these kinds of books in?  Do you have to look in an "alternative" bookstore
for most of them?  Any help would be appreciated (I can send you the list
if you want).

Indeed.  But that code is law, not morality.  I think the point here was not 
a discussion of anarchy vs. law.  I think that most see the benefit of a non-
anarchistic system.  Our incredibly high standard of living is based on 
technology, derived from an ordered existance.  We wouln't have got far if 
we were still bashing each other over the head with clubs, right?

The question becomes, is it possible to have an ordered society in which 
the laws are recognized to be in place based on _enlightened self interest_ 
as opposed to morality? 

And secondly, assuming a satisfactory _legal_ code is in place, and we 
choose to persue individual freedoms as far as possible, is a _moral 
code_ required or even acceptable?

Can an agreement ever be reached?  At what point do we start to comprimise?

Think about these questions in light of some recent social issues:

	Topic			Legal?		     Moral?
	
	Homosexuality 		Yes		(insertopinionhere)
	Drug use		No		      ditto
	Prostitution		No (gen.)	      ditto
	Abortion		Yes (gen.)	      ditto
	Prayer in school	No (gen.)	      ditto
	Tabacco taxation :-)	Yes		      ditto
	Spanking :-)		Yes		      ditto
	Reading news :-)	Yes		       No

You milage may vary depending on your state/country! :-)

I would guess that it probably has something to do with the ease of which
ideas and thoughts are communicated on a college campus.  In the real world
(tm) it's easier for theists (well, people in general really) to lock
themselves into a little bubble where they only see and talk to those
people who are of the same opinion as they are.  In college you are
constantly surrounded by and have to interact with people who have
different ideas about life, the universe, and everything.  It is much much
harder to build a bubble around yourself to keep everyone else's ideas from
reaching you.

So, in a world where theists are forced to contend with and listen to
atheists and theists of other religions some are bound to have a change in
their beliefs over four years.  There is nowhere to run.... :-)

Once the Rushdie situation exploded into the media, the Muslim voice on
the matter of the book was effectively restricted to short video bytes
showing
the dramatic highlights of Muslim demonstrations. For every twenty or so
newspaper, magazine articles, interviews etc. supporting Rushdie, there
would
appear one Muslim voice. This person was usually selected based on how
dramatic and incoherent he was, not on his knowledge of Islam or the
situation at the time. This approx. twenty to one ratio continued
throughout the escalation of the crisis, with Rushdie in the central
spotlight as the man of the moment, the valiant defender of everyman's
right to free speech decoupled from responsibility. (As an aside, it's
interesting that while the hue and cry about freedom of speech went up,
some books (defaming certain ethnic and religious groups) continued
to be banned here. It was felt that they injured the sensibilities of these

groups and presented a false image which could promote feelings of 
hate towards these groups. For Muslims this kind of double standard 
was annoying.)

Rushdie saw this spotlight as a golden opportunity to lash out at
"organized"
Islam, and he did so with admirable verbal skill. The only kind of Islam
which Rushdie finds palatable is what he calls a "secular" Islam - an Islam
separated from it's Qur'an, it's Prophet, God, its legislation, and most
importantly from any intrusion into any political arena. Fine - Rushdie
made
his views known - the Muslim's made their anger at his book known. The
scale of the whole affair erupted into global proportions - it was, by this
time,
already a political situation - affecting governments as well as
individuals.
The situation was a serious one, with far-reaching political implications.
At the centre of this turmoil was Rushdie, throwing fuel on the fire -
engaged
in a personal crusade that made him oblivious to any sense of caution.

Now you may feel that the person in the centre of a worldwide storm such as

this has no responsibility, has no reason to exercise restraint of any
kind, has no
obligation to perhaps step back momentarily out of the spotlight till
matters calm down. Perhaps you even feel that he is justified in "boldly"
defying the anger of all those who dare to take umbrage at his literary
work, no matter what insult they find within it. Perhaps you see him as
a kind of secular "heroic Knight",mounted on the his media steed,
 doing battle with the "dragon" of Islamic "fundamentalism".

Well Khomeini saw him as a disingeneous author who 
grew up in a Muslim atmosphere, knew well what Muslim's hold dear, 
who wrote a book which mischievously uses certain literary conventions
to slander, insult, and attack Islam and its most notable personalities -
who, when
faced with a situation that became a worldwide crisis, continued with
his mischief in the world stage of the media - who, even after people were
injured and killed because of the magnitude and emotion of the situation,
continued his mischief, instead of having the good sense to desist.
Khomeini saw the crisis as mischief making on a grand scale, mischief
making that grew in scale as the scale of the crisis enlarged. The deaths
of Muslims around the world and Rushdie's continued media mischief
even after this, was the triggering factor that seemed to
decide Khomeini on putting a stop to the mischief. The person at the
centre of all these events was Rushdie - he was the source of the
continuing mischief - all media support, government support was
just that - support. The source was Rushdie (and his publishers, who
were nothing short of ecstatic at the publicity and were very happy
to see Rushdie constantly in the media). The Islamic rulings that
deal with people who engage in this kind of grand-scale mischief
making, was applied to Rushdie.

>You're attempts at justification are not doing the
> image of Islam any good.

I have made no attempts at justification, only at explanation. "Image" is
the chief concern of Muslim 'apologists' for Islam and for Rushdie.
If Muslims willingly relegated themselves to becoming a sub-culture
within a larger secular culture, such that the secular principles and laws
had precedence over the laws of Islam - then I have no doubt that Islam
would then be thought to have a good "image" (Principally because it would
by and large reflect the secular image). A "good image" usually means " be
more
like me".

Your attempts at TOTALLY exonerating Rushdie reflect exactly the attitude
that
resulted in the polarization brought about by the crisis.

The fatwa came later - much later. If Rushdie didn't mouth off so much in
the
media, the fuss would have died down - no one would have been killed, no
fatwa would have been passed - the whole episode would have fizzled away.

Ah! Excellent. So why doesn't she appear to me? I'm a little weak in the
blind faith department. (Besides, she doesn't even really need to appear:
how about, oh say, a little tip - something like "put your all on #3 in the

I'm afraid I don't know arabic; I have only read translations. I wouldn't
know it if it were well-written. (Consistent, though, is one thing the Quran
is not.)  And have *you* read it in arabic?  Besides, some of my best

Yes, so? How do we know they *weren't* very good? (Again, assuming that the

I haven't interviewed all muslims about this; I would really like it if this

What other basis do we have to judge a system? Especially when we can't get
a consistent picture of what Islam "really" is. Do I believe Khomeini? Do I
go by the Imam of the mosque in Mecca? Or perhaps the guy in New Jersey? Or
perhaps you say I should go only by the Quran. Ok, whose translation? And
what about things like "And wherever you find idolators, kill them"?

I am looking for experiences people have had with Mormons and your
views of Mormonism because of these experiences.

I would appreciate only experiences that have happened to you...not
friend of a friend stuff.  Also, I would like to hear good 
experiences you might have had with Mormons.  I am doing this
in the interest of spreading tolerance, so please, no flames.

E-mail would be preferred because of the short time for this.

Thanks,

Well, it looks like the folks in soc.religion.islam have loosened up
a bit and are discussing this topic as well as the banking/interest
topic.  A few books on the subject have also been mentioned in addition
to the one you mentioned.  These may be hard to find, but I think I may
take a stab at it out of curiosity.  I know the one film I saw on this
subject was pretty weak and the only two quotes I have seen which were
used to show science in the Koran (which I posted here) were also pretty 
vague.  I suspect that these books will extrapolate an awful lot on the
quotes they have.

At least one poster on the Islam channel seems to have some misgivings
about the practice of using the Koran to decide what is good science.

I wonder if Islam has ever come up with the equivalent of the Christians
"Creation Science" on any topic.  It would be interesting to find a history
of scientific interpretations of the Koran, to see if anyone used the Koran
to support earlier science which has since been discarded.  It is all too
easy to look at science as it exists today and then "interpret" passages
to match those findings.  People do similar things with the sayings of
Nostradamus all the time.

Anyway, it is a rather unique claim of Islam and may be worth checking.

Basically, any prophet I've ever dealt with has either been busy 
hawking stolen merchandise or selling swampland house lots in 
Florida.  Then you hear all the stories of sexual abuse by prophets
and how the families of victims were paid to keep quiet about it.

Never mind that, but let me tell you about this Chevelle I bought 
from this dude (you guessed it, a prophet) named Mohammed.  I've
got the car for like two days when the tranny kicks, then Manny, 
my mechanic, tells me it was loaded with sawdust!  Take a guess

And, hangings and firing squads are allowed today, too.  And, if these
things were not considered cruel, then surely a medical execution
(painless) would not be, either.

Then you better pray for me, too, because I believe that the Mighty

Prayer in school is legal; what is illegal is telling children
what to pray, or not to pray.  Many people confuse "you can't
tell kids that they ought to pray now" with "kids aren't allowed
to pray", possibly because so few kids do so without being told.

But you STILL value likely ways over unlikely ways, correct? If I wanted to
know the "truth" about, say, the specific gravity of chicken soup, I could 
employ science -- meters, gauges, scales, etc. -- or I could just talk a walk 
on a beach somewhere. Both have a possibility of generating the truthful 
answer -- in the case of the walk on the beach, it would have to be some sort 
of sudden inspiration about the specific gravity of chicken soup which just 
happened to be truthful -- so what makes me choose the scientific method of 
truth-determination over the "walk on the beach" method? Because I *VALUE* 
science's higher probability of obtaining truth, that's why. Everywhere one 
turns, there is intentionality and value judgments lurking just beneath the 
veneer of detached objectivity. It is an inescapable aspect of the human 
condition.

Well, I would add that the attribute "works even when not being measured" is 
*ALSO* something which is valued and intended, Eric. All you've succeeded in 
doing is kicking this up another level in the hierarchy of values.

The point is that when we recognize these "instantiations" of mathematical
systems, we do so because we VALUE being able to describe and perhaps even 
to control these instantiations. There is always a driving purpose behind
thought -- a motive, if you will. Sometimes that motive is relatively 
"pure", e.g. pursuit of knowledge, othertimes it's "impure", e.g. pursuit
of money, or of physical pleasure. But it's always there. And even when it
is a "pure" pursuit of knowledge, presumably one pursues knowledge in order
to personally grow, develop, advance to a higher plane of being. So there
is still an element of acquisition, of reaching, of grasping, even in the
approach of the "detached, objective" scientist.

>They aren't the same.

No, I think you are the one who is rather confused. There are two senses
in which we can say that the phenomenon of "the working of the DES chip" is 
value-based:

	1) Because there is bound to be some reason why we built the DES
	   chip and started it running in the first place

		and

	2) Because the very notion/definition/concept of "works" has value
	   associated with it

The first is a CAUSAL linkage -- we want it to work, therefore we CAUSE it to 
work. That is rather a mundane interpretation. The second, however, is a more 
subtle and deeper PHENOMENOLOGICAL linkage -- that the attribute "works" is 
itself, as everything else, presented to the human consciousness as a _valued_ 
fact, not just a fact-in-itself. You are perhaps justified in shooting down 
the causal linkage, but you have not begun to address the phenomenological 
linkage.

Our predictions or confirmations that suns shine in unpopulated solar systems
are, however, items of value.

Again, our predictions or confirmations of the working of genetic algorithms
are items of value.

The universe does not DEPEND on human values, no, but our experience and
understanding and concepts of the universe _are_ laced with human values.
Phenomenologically, everything is value-related, since the thing which is 
experiencing the phenomena, i.e. self, is itself value-driven. Self is, in 
fact, the very SOURCE of all values. Whatever involves self involves values.

Yes, this took some getting used to -- of course not having an Indian
connection, no knowledge of hindi, etc., this was not trivial for me.
I did have, thanks to the wonders of the net, "A Glossary to *Satanic
Verses*", posted to rec.arts.books by Vijay Raghavan, which explains a
lot of the Indian English constructions, Indian culture references,
even the Islamic references ("Jahilia", "Submission", the context of
the Satanic Verses incident, etc.) -- what I have only covers the
first couple of hundred pages, but it helped me get into the flow of
the novel [I can mail this to anyone interested; if anyone has
portions after part I, if they exist, I'd like to get those].

What is your reaction to people who claim they were abducted by space aliens?

Some of these people say, "I was abducted, experimented on, etc."
If we insist that these aliens don't exist is the burden of proof placed on
us. These people can give no hard facts but can give a lot of testimony to
back up their beliefs.

Replace <space aliens> with <elvis>, <big foot>, <blue unicorns>, 
and we have a larger percentage of the population than I like to think
about.

Sometimes I wonder if reality really is a different experience for everone.

Of course.  Hitchings believes in evolution.  The purpose of the quote I
sited was to show the ambivalance that evolutionists have with their own
theory.  For example, on page 107 he states, "...one may question an 
evolution theory so beset by doubts among even those who teach it.  If
Darwinism is truely the great unifying principle of biology, it encompasses
extraordinarily large areas of ignorance.  It fails to explain some of the
basic questions of all -- how lifeless chemicals came alive, what rules of
grammer lie behind the genetic code, how genes shap and form living things."

SO?
What's your point?

MAYBE TO ME! (In this example, and as I argue below, that's not even
true.)

Not necessarily.

But science is also good for technology, which may or may not
have anything to do with truth. I may value technology and
not truth, after all.

Spare me. This is nonsense, Frank. Pregnancy is sometimes referred
to as having a "bun in the oven." Does this mean that the uterus
is at 450 F? Argument by idiom is weak indeed, and it's what
you're engaging in here.

Of course it's different. $3!=ma. What is at issue is accuracy,
not difference.

This is the result of a chain of deduction about the value
of understanding the universe. One can make the observation
that IF one wanted to understand the universe, F=ma would be
valuable without believing F=ma to be valuable, Frank.

>I'm valuing it, whether implicitly or
>directly, because I'm saying that things that have a basis in reality
>are different to other things which do not.
Things which have a basis in reality are different from things
which have a basis in reality. Quantum mechanics is very different
from biochemistry, yet they both (allegedly) have basises in reality.
Look, Frank, noone said that people didn't do science because they
value it(in the sense of think it is good), but that is not necessary
to make the observation that it's results have value (in the sense
that they are accurate.) Allow me to give you an example: I think
that knowing the byte order on IBM 3090s is pretty much worthless
(I don't care to know it) but I would be quite prepared to
note as valuable (i.e. accurate) the claim that it was Big-endian
if it was shown to be so (like, by showing me the manual.)

No, it's fleeking not. Scientific judgement is SOLELY the sense
of evaluating an expression (accuracy). It has nothing to do with
importance, worthiness, or usefulness. Choice of problems DOES
have to do with those factors, but they are orthogonal to
evaluating (for accuracy) solutions to chosen problems.

No, I was saying that it works independently of whether I measure
it, which is something quite different.

It would if they were the same thing, which they are not.

Frank, you are attempting to inject "goodness" judgements where there
are only "accuracy" judgements, by essentially punning on the word
'value' which has both meanings. "useful" is a goodness judgement.
"Reasonable" is an accuracy judgement. They are not the same
thing at all. ("Useful in making some conclusion" is an accuracy
judgement again, I'm afraid.) Sorry, Frank, but all you're doing is
using the ambiguity of English to obfuscate the issue. IF you
mean to say that science is based on value (accuracy) judgements,
I have no problem with that. If you mean to say that it's based
on value (goodness) judgements, that's nonsense. By contrast,
morality is clearly based on goodness judgements.

On a similar note, a good friend of mine worked as a clerk in a
chain bookstore.  Several of his peers were amazing, one woman in
particular:

A customer asked her if they had _The Autobiography of Benjamin
Franklin_.  "Who's it by?" was her first question.  Then, "Is he
still alive?"  Then, "Is it fiction or non-fiction?" 

Finally my friend intervened, and showed the guy where it was.
 
It makes one wonder what the standards of employment are.

Mathew:

Could you let us know when this happened, so I can see if my version
is as up-to-date as possible?  I try to re-save the FAQs once in a 
while, but otherwise I ignore their regular postings, so I wouldn't 
generally notice such a change.

And I like to stay current.

Thanks,

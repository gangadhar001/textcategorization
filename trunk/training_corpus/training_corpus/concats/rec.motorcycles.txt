Three, actually.  I believe I discussed countersteering a horse
before.

Basically, there are two ways to steer a horse, plow-rein and
neck-rein.  Plow-reining steers him by keeping the reins separate, and
you pull in the direction you wish to go.  Neck-reining steers a horse
by holding the reins together in one hand, and pulling against the
horse's neck in the direction you wish to go.  When training a
plow-steering horse to neck-rein, one technique is to cross the reins
under his necks.  Thus, when neck-reining to the left, the right rein
pulls against the right side of the neck, but the left side of the bit
(which the horse is used to from his plow-reining days).

Are you sorry you asked yet?

Well, it's been fun. This is my last day at Bellcore and
It will be a while before I have net access again (taking
time off and scheduling Military Schools for the summer
on joint operations, and anything else that looks good).
I have had a blast reading, responding and commenting on
things posted here. My final say is 9mm's are inferior
to .45's errr oh wrong news group. Hopefully I'll be back.
I guess "internet withdrawl" starts around 1pm or so and
considering I never knew inet existed 2 years ago I am
really going to miss it. 

OH yea, to the guy who called me this morning about the
"Military issue" boots, good luck, I think you will be
happy with the tankers boots.

I am in complete concordance with you there, Mike.  I was a Silver StarRider
instructor, for a while.  I learn't about countersteering last year
and I have been riding bikes since 1976.  We were never told about
countersteering when being taught to instruct.  It doesn't seem to have
affected me or my friends or pupils.  We just rode in blissful ignorance.

One day out riding, my friend and i were passing a field of goats and
noticed 2 out on the road. As we slowed to pass the ram made a dash at 
my friend just missing him and then tangling it self up in the barb wire
fence. Being good samaritains and generally nice guys we turned around to 
untrangle the goat from the barbed wire. As I pulled up next to him
(seeing him still tangled up), stopped the bike and got off the Goat had
vanished (into the field I guess).

Anti Freeze

I was wrong, still had the issue of "Street Rodder" in
my last pile. In the February 1991 issue on page 24 there
is an advirtisement for anti freeze.
 
AND IT MAKES A GREAT PARTY MIXER
The Neo Synthetic Oil Company has a reputation for
developing overkill priducts the protect and extend
the life of mechinical things, and here is there latest
development. Propylene Glycol, probably the finest radiator 
coolant available. After 100,000 miles of testing, they find
it has a boiling point of 365 degrees (much higher than
conventional coolants)- which helps elminate detonation and 
pinging, it allows the use of smaller radiators in race cars,
it will not damage aluminum blocks or heads, and it is 
environmentally safe. Yep, this is the good stuff.

If he's not, I will.  Put two riders on identical machines.  It's the
one who knows what he's doing, and why, that will be faster.  It *may*
be possible to improve your technique if you have no idea what it is,
through trial and error, but it is not very effective methodology.
Only by understanding the technique of steering a motorcycle can one
improve on that technique (I hold that this applies to any human
endeavor).

>that's all it is - an interesting bit of knowledge, and to claim that
>it is essential for all bikers to know it, or that you can corner faster
>or better as a result, is absurd.

Do you consider an understanding of the physics of traction absurd?
Are you seriously suggesting that one can form a traction management
policy without understanding what it is or what factors increase or
decrease available traction?  Braking?

It is highly unlikely that any biker is going to develop his maximum
swerving ability without any knowledge of turning techniques.  For most
of his riding life this may not be a problem, but in an emergency
situation it is very definately placing him at a disadvantage.

>But by including countersteering
>theory in newbie courses we are confusing people unnecessarily, right at

I disagree.  The existance and immense success of riding courses which
teach the technique indicate that the concept can be taught in a manner
that is neither confusing, nor detracts from any other aspects of the
course.

>And that was my original point.

Perhaps, but in the ensuing discussion, you strayed far from that
point, to claim that knowledge of steering technique is irrelevant to a
rider's ability.  I find this assertion ludicrous.

THe original battery in an 8-10 year old BMW may be fine.  Mine lasted many
years.  The replacement 30AH battery from BMW was a disaster.  The mechanic
from Comp. Acc. told me that CA would warantee replace the bad one with a
new one of the same evil bad batteries and tell the customer if they have
problems to bring it back and they'd do it again.  It seems that many of
those 30AH batteries were DOA, near-DOA, and always unlikely to be going
strong by the end of the warantee period on them.  THere was a big batch of
bad ones, and they replaced them with -you guessed it - more bad ones.  BMW
switched to a 25AH battery that has more cold cranking amps, even if it has
less total juice.  

I switched to a YUASA that has even more cold cranking amps and cost one
third fewer dollars.

Men!  Have you had unprotected sex today with as many fertile
women as possible?  If not, why not?  Women!  Did you menstruate
without attempting to conceive this month?  You murderesses!

In Holtsingerian terms, a total ban on contraception is the
logical consequence of pro-life reasoning.

A "moment of silence" doesn't mean much unless *everyone*
participates.  Otherwise it's not silent, now is it?

Non-religious reasons for having a "moment of silence" for a dead
classmate: (1) to comfort the friends by showing respect to the
deceased , (2) to give the classmates a moment to grieve together, (3)
to give the friends a moment to remember their classmate *in the
context of the school*, (4) to deal with the fact that the classmate
is gone so that it's not disruptive later.

Blindly opposing everything with a flavor of religion in it is
utterly idiotic.

Did anyone say the world existed forever, never was created, and has an
endless supply of energy?

Also, there are lots of people like myself who don't think that the spon-
taneous generation of life from non-life is such an incredible event, given
a billion years or so for it to take place.
#undef rant_mode

"Imaginative thinking" probably isn't the right thing to ask.  The thing is,
as you no doubt have already been told, that Genesis 1 does not constitute
a scientific theory.  Given a scientific theory of the origin of the universe
or earth or anything else, we can decide what sort of things we expect to be
true about today's universe.  What predictions does Genesis 1 make about
today's universe that disagree with the standard "scientific" version,
and how can we test them?

If this is what you want to do, keep in mind that, despite the considerable
length of time t.o has existed, no one has yet succeeded.

It is true that Mormons believe that all spirits (including Jesus,
Lucifer, Robert Weiss) are in the same family.  It does not mean
that Jesus was created, but rather that Lucifer and Robert Weiss
were not.  I agree that this is a "heresy".  So what?  
The sweating of blood in Gethsemene is
not a basic Mormon doctrine.  Jesus did not perform the atonement
in Getheseme alone, as some anti-Mormons are trying to teach.  
As far as the "unpardonable sin" whatever that is, it is Biblical,
and not specifically Mormon.  It is also called the sin against
the Holy Ghost.  Most Bible scholars (other than conservative
ones) do not believe Jehovah and Elohim were always the same.
I'm sure you've heard of the J and the E texts?  I don't
know what you mean by "That He needed to be saved".  Jesus?
Jehovah?  Elohim?  In Mormon doctrine, Jesus was sinless,
and thus did not "need to be saved".

In two places at once? Bit of a coincidence, that.

Whatever the faults the FBI had, the fact is that responsibility
for those deaths lies with Koresh.

Read the articles about the "arrest" of Randy Weaver.  The BATF were on
the verge of using these very tactics on a house containing children and
were only stopped by the arrival of the press on the scene.

Let me clarify.  In order to more clearly understand scripture, one must
look in the context of where the verse is found.  The section you refer
to here is found in Luke 22.  I'd like to start back at verse 35 and I'll
include it here for the sake of completeness:

   Then Jesus asked them, "When I sent you without purse, bag or sandals,
   did you lack anything?"
   "Nothing." the disciples replied.

Verse 36 says:  "But now, if you have a purse take it and also a bag; and
    if you don't have a sword, sell your cloak and buy one.  It is written,
    "And he was numbered with the transgressors."

Verse 38 says:  The disciples said, "See, Lord, here are two swords."
                "That is enough."  he replied.

What does this all mean?
 
In verse 35, Jesus points out to the disciples that when he sent them out
previously, they did not need to take anything with them.  Their food,
lodging and transport were often provided through the generosity of others.
If verse 36, Jesus alludes to the change in attitude that is to come in the
near future.  Remember, Jesus was saying these things shortly before he was
to be arrested.  In verse 36, He tells the disciples that they will have
to take their own possessions and provisions with them.  THey will have to
carry their own purse because there will be no longer any generosity from
anyone.  And there will be times of peril when they will have to take care
of themselves.  This was implied by the reference to the sword.  Jesus knew
that He was going to be arrested and labeled as a criminal.  The charges
brought against Him were likely to be passed on to his disciples.

In verse 38, we see that the disciples have taken Jesus too literally.  It is
not the first time that the disciples got His message wrong.  They had done 
this on several occassions.  Instead of understanding the gist of His words,
they presented Him with two swords.  Jesus was perhaps taken aback by
this promptly concludes the discussion by saying, "That is enough."

The disciples could not understand why Jesus had to die.  Jesus kept telling
them over and over again that He would soon not be with them but they could
not grasp this.  They wanted their Messiah to be a political leader who would
lead them in rebellion against the Romans.  That is why they were so keen on
presenting Him with the swords.  They had no idea that Jesus was referring to
a different kingdom of which they were to be a part of.  The disciples could
only perceive of a kingdom on earth rather than the one in Heaven.

Understand that Jesus NEVER intended his followers to take up arms in rebellion.
This was clearly in evidence in Luke 22:51 when Jesus rebuked his disciples for 
using the sword against the servant of the high priest when they came to arrest 
Him.  As further evidence, Jesus goes so far as to heal the man injured by the disciples.  Jesus did NOT condone violence as a means for His purpose.

Contrast this behaviour with that of David Koresh and you will clearly see that
DK was NOT Jesus as he claimed.  Jesus surrendered himself to the authourities
and allowed himself to be crucified.  He didn't go out in a blaze of glory, but
rather Jesus was executed like a common criminal.  

I hope this makes it a little more clear.

God be with you,

And does it not say in scripture that no man knows the hour of His coming, not
even the angels in Heaven but only the Father Himself?  DK was trying to play
God by breaking the seals himself.  DK killed himself and as many of his
followers as he could.  BTW, God did save the children.  They are in Heaven,
a far better place.  How do I know?  By faith.

God be with you,

Just to remark that I have heard that David Koresh has risen from 
the dead.  I dont know if it is true or not, but this is what I have
been told.  What do you guys think?

That some results are not "objective" means neither that all results are
non-objective, nor that "physics" is non-objective.

umm, please don't lump us all together. It's those blatant,

Some of these "cults", which seems like a rather dismissive term
to me, are pretty big here in the USA.  Most of them
are quite respectable & neiborly & do not resemble Branch Davidians
in the least; confusing them is a mistake.  What about "live &
let live", folks?  I'm sure we can uncover a few extremist loonies
who are Catholic -- the anti-abortion movement in the USA seems to have a
few hard cases in it, for example.

I have to agree Matthew with this; I have certainly encountered a lot
of anti-Catholic-religion propaganda & emotion (& some bigotry) from
members of certain religious groups here.  They also practice their
missionary work with zeal among Catholics in the United States, but to
someone who is or was raised Catholic such rhetoric is pretty
off-putting.  It may work better in an environment where there's a lot
of popular anti-clericalism.

Follow-ups set elsewhere, this no longer seems very relevant to Celtic issues
to me.

Not necessarily. It is much the same problem as the Eve hypothesis. If
all, or most, of the copies that were available when printing became
common were decended from the same copy, a change in that copy would
propagate to all modern copies, even if there were other copies in 
existence at the time of the change. Very few libraries would have
duplicates of a non-religious book, so there would be few opportunities
for anyone to notice that there were variations. Even if someone did
notice, they would be more likely to copy the variation that conformed
to their expectations and ignore the others.

	There are actually a few important things we can glean from this mess:
1)	When they start getting desperate for an answer to the question: "What's
it all about. Mr. Natural?", pinkboys will buy darn near *anything*, which
means:
2)	There's still plenty of $$$$ to be made in the False Jesus business
by enterprising SubGenii.  Just remember that:
3)	Once you've separated the pinks from their green, don't blow it all
on automatic weapons from Mexico.  Put it in a Swiss bank account.  Smile a
lot.  Have your flunkies hand out flowers in airports.  The Con will just
shrug you off as long as:
4)	You never, never, NEVER start to believe your own bulldada!  If
"David Koresh" hand't started swallowing his own "apocalypso now" crap, he'd
be working crossword puzzles in the Bahamas today instead of contributing to
the mulch layer in Waco.  This is because:
5)	When you start shooting at cops, they're likely to shoot back.  And 
most of 'em are better shots than you are.

	In short:
	- P.T. Barnum was right 
		and
	- Stupidity is self-correcting
Thus endeth the lesson.

I think you are using the wrong analogy.  A better one would be:
you see some elves.  I don't.  Where is the burden of proof there?
